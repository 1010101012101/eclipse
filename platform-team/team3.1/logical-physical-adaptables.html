<h1>Solution 1: Support Logical Resources - Adaptables<br>
</h1>
This document outlines a possible solution to the adaptables problem
outlined in the <a href="logical-physical-public.html"><strong>Support
Logical Resources</strong></a> plan item problem description document.
Interested parties should review
this document and verify that their use cases are reflected in the
requirements then later that the solution provided satisfies their
needs. Feedback is strongly encouraged and may be provided on the
platform-team-rev mailing list or in the <a

<h3>IlModelElement</h3>
<p>This solution involves adding an interface to the Resources plugin
that maps logical elements to physical ones. The interface is purposely
simple with logical model manipulations omitted. A client can't use
this interface to display logical models or gain any interesting
additional knowledge about it.</p>
<p>Current plugins that add object contributions to <code>IResource</code>
(CVS, Search, Compare) would have to also add them to <code>IModelElement</code>
and honour the bindings provided by the logical resource. Moreover, the
plugins that adapted to <code>IResource</code> to these object
contributions shown in the context menu should no longer adapt the <code>IResource</code>
and instead implement <code>IModelElement</code> (this could be
simplified by adding a tag to the objectConribution XML that indicates
that it can be used with <code>IResource</code> or <code>IModelElement</code>).</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>/**<br> * This interface defines an element of an application that models the<br> * data/processes of a particular problem domain.

</blockquote>
<h3>ITraversal</h3>
<p>A logical model element can be made up of one or more traversals
that define the physical resources that make up the model element.
Traversals are used to allow the clients of the traversal to optimize
their operations based on the depth of the resources being traversed.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>/** <br> * A model element traversal is simply a set of resources and<br> * the depth to which each are to be traversed. A set of traversals<br> * is used to describe the resources that constitute a model element.<br> *<br> * @see org.eclipse.core.resources.IResource<br> * @see org.eclipse.core.resources.model.IModelElement<br> */<br>public interface ITraversal {<br>   <br>    /**<br>     * Returns the file system resource(s) for this traversal. <br>     * The returned resources must be contained within the same project <br>     * and need not exist in the local file system.<br>     * <br>     * The traversal of the returned resources should be done considering<br>     * the flag returned by getDepth. If a resource returned by a <br>     * traversal is a file, it should always be visited. If a resource of a traversal<br>     * is a folder then files contained in the folder can only be visited if the folder is<br>     * IResource.DEPTH_ONE or IResource.DEPTH_INFINITE. <br>     * Child folders should only be visited if the depth is IResource.DEPTH_INFINITE.<br>     */<br>    public IResource[] getResources();<br>    <br>    /**<br>     * Return the depth to which the resources should be traversed.<br>     * @return the depth to which the physical resources are to be traversed<br>     * (one of IResource.DEPTH_ZERO, IResource.DEPTH_ONE or IResource.DEPTH_INFINITE)<br>     */<br>    public int getDepth();<br>}</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>IModelContext</h3>
<p>One of the advantages of a logical model traversal API is that it
allows plug-ins to implement any operations they desire
in terms of logical resources (e.g. CVS update, CVS commit, CVS tag,
dirty
decoration, etc.). However, the context of the operation may imply that
resources that don't exist locally should be included in the operation.
This is not a problem for some logical models. For instance, a java
package is a container visited to a depth of one. Also, the plugin
example knows all the files that vould potentially be involved, even if
they don't exist locally. Given this, a repository provider can easily
determine that outgoing deletions should be included when committing or
that incoming additions should be included when updating.</p>
<p>However, properly determining the set of traversals that adequately
cover a model element gets more complicated if the resources that
constitute the element depend of the contents of a manifest file (or
some other similar mechanism) and may change over time. In this case,
it is possible that the model element could access the contents of the
manifest file as contained in the remote location. Given this ability,
the model element provider is provided with enough context about the
operation to the logical model element so a set of traversal can be
returned that adequately cover all resources that constitute the model
element. </p>
<p>This has led to the definition of the following <code>IModelContext</code>
interface. </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>/**<br> * A model context provides a model element with a view of the remote state<br> * of a local resource as it relates to a repository operation that is in<br> * progress. A repository provider can pass an instance of this interface to a<br> * model element when obtaining a set of traversals for a model element. This<br> * allows the model element to query the remote state of a resource in order to<br> * determine if there are resources that exist remotely but do not exist locally<br> * that should be included in the traversal.<br> */<br>public interface IModelContext {<br> <br>    /**<br>     * Return whether the contents of the corresponding remote differs from the<br>     * content of the local file.

</blockquote>
<p>Although this can be thought of as a repository provider API, it
bypasses the complexity by allowing the repository provider to
implement the interface in a maner specific to the operation being
performed. For instance, for a commit, the repository provider would
provide the contents of files that define the base of a manifest file.
In other words, the contents of the file would match the contents
before the user modified the model element. This would allow for the
inclusion of any outgoing deletions. For an update, the repository
provider would provide access to the contents of the file in the
repository.</p>
<h2>How this will affect existing plug-ins</h2>
There are two types of plug-ins this will affect, those that adapt
elements in the workbench to IResource to get menu contributions and
the plug-in that contributes the contributions. Here is the list of
extension points with "adaptable" attributes:<br>
<br>
org.eclipse.ui.decorators<br>
org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus<br>
org.eclipse.ui.propertyPages<br>
<br>
All extension points document that "adaptable=true" means the object
must be adaptable to IResource. And here is the list of references to
these extension points in the SDK:<br>

<br>
</span>For the plug-ins contributing extensions to adaptable extension
points they will have to make two changes to support the new model
element APIs:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Update their plugin.xml files and add IModelElement in the
objectClass of their adaptable contributions.</li>
  <li>Update their actions to work on ITraversals instead of IResource
and respect the depth constraints provided in the traversals.</li>
  <li>(Optional) provide a IModelContext if they manage remote resources</li>
</ol>
And for plugi-ins that define UI elements with adaptable elements to
IResource, they will have to change the IAdaptable#getAdapter() methods
to return IModelElement instead of IResource. Here are some examples:<br>
<p>For some model elements, simple traversals can be used to describe
the element. For instance, here is an example traversal that represents
a Java package.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>/**<br> * An example traversal for a Java package<br> */<br>public class JavaPackageTraversal implements ITraversal {<br>    IContainer javaPackage;<br>    public JavaPackageTraversal(IContainer javaPackage) {<br>        this.javaPackage = javaPackage;<br>    }<br>    public IResource[] getResources() {<br>        return new IResource[] { javaPackage };<br>    }<br>    public int getDepth() {<br>        return IResource.DEPTH_ONE;<br>    }<br>}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The next example class shows a traversal for a fixed set of files.
The chosen example is for the data files that define the properties of
a plugin in Eclipse. The same files are always returned even if they
don't exist locally. It is up to the client of the interface in this
case to decide how to handle the files that don't exist locally. If the
client is a repository and the operation is an update to fetch the
latest contents from the server, then the repository provider would
fetch the files from the server if they now esist there or ignore them
if they don't exist either locally or remotely.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>/**<br> * An example of a fixed traversal that always includes<br> * a certain set of files even if they don't exist <br> * locally<br> */<br>public class PluginDataTraversal implements ITraversal {<br>    IProject pluginProject;<br>    public PluginDataTraversal(IProject project) {<br>        this.pluginProject = project;<br>    }<br>    public IResource[] getResources() {<br>        return new IResource[] {<br>                pluginProject.getFile(new Path("plugin.xml")),<br>                pluginProject.getFile(new Path("plugin.properties")),<br>                pluginProject.getFile(new Path("build.properties")),<br>                pluginProject.getFile(new Path("META-INF/MANIFEST.MF"))<br>        };<br>    }<br>    public int getDepth() {<br>        return IResource.DEPTH_ZERO;<br>    }<br>}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p> Assuming that the plugin data consists of the above mentioned files
and the contents of the schema directory, the model element class for a
plugin's data model could be the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>/**<br> * A plugin model element<br> */<br>public class PluginModel implements IModelElement {<br>    IProject pluginProject;<br>    public IProject getProject() {<br>        return pluginProject;<br>    }<br>    public ITraversal[] getTraversals(ITraversalContext context,<br>            IProgressMonitor monitor) throws CoreException {<br>        return new ITraversal[] {<br>            new PluginDataTraversal(pluginProject),<br>            new ITraversal() {<br>                public IResource[] getResources() {<br>                    return new IResource[] {<br>                        pluginProject.getFolder("schema")<br>                    };<br>                }<br>                // Traverse the folder deeply to include all children<br>                public int getDepth() {<br>                    return IResource.DEPTH_INFINITE;<br>                }<br>            }<br>        };<br>    }<br>}</pre>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h2>Eclipse Platform Issues</h2>
<p>The following issues would need to be addressed for this solutions</p>
<ol>
  <li>ObjectContributions have to be duplicated in the plugins that
would like to provide both contributions for <code>IResource</code>
and <code>ILogicalResource</code>. </li>
  <ul>
    <li>This could be simplified by adding support to tag an
objectContribution for use with both interfaces<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>(Bug 53217) Logical classes (e.g. java model, UML) have to
implement the
interface instead of adapting to it. This is a limitation of the
current objectContribution story in the workbench. </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Again, this could be circumvented with support in the UI that
does the same magic for <code>ILogicalResource</code> that is done for
      <code>IResource</code></li>
    <br>
  </ul>
  <li>Plugins that add object contributions will have to modify their
actions to handle logical resources. There should be some standard UI
components for showing the mappings. For instance you could show the
logical model at the top and in a details part the physical
files/folders that will be affected by the operation.</li>
  <li>Would it be possible to add a workbench adapter to specific
implementations IModelElement in order to get an image and label for a
model element?<br>
  </li>
</ol>
