<h1>Deployment Provider</h1>
<p>Prior to Eclipse 3.0, Team provided a single intergation point for connecting 
  a local project to a remote repository or data store. The Repository Provider 
  integration point serves two purposes: it associates one or more projects with 
  a repository and gives the repostory tool a certain degree of control over modifications 
  made to the respources of controlled projects. </p>
<p>In 3.0, another integration point, Deployment Provider, has been added. The 
  purpose of a Deployment Provider is to associate a project or folder with a 
  non-versioning server such as FTP or WebDAV.</p>
<p>One deployment provider per resource? This affects IDeploymentManager.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the Depolyment Provider API is to aid in the implementation 
  of Deployment providers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Managment of providers: API exists to manage provider life-cycle.</li>
  <li>Persistance of providers: The state required to recreate a deployment provider 
    is persisted as project meta-data.Team provides facilities to aid in the saving 
    and loading of the state information.</li>
  <li>Reusable UI Components:</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no API for initially creating a particular deployment provider. It 
  is left to the provider implementor to determine how and when local resources 
  should be mapped to their provider.</p>
<p>Briefly summarize classes involved and point to examples</p>
