		<h2>About the Eclipse Project</h2>
    	<p>The Eclipse Project is an open source project of eclipse.org, overseen 
	      by a <a href="team-leaders.php">Project Management Committee</a> (PMC) 
      	  and project leaders. The work is done in subprojects working against <a href="http://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.platform/developer">Git 
	      repositories</a>. The <a href="eclipse-charter.php">Eclipse Project Charter</a> 
      	  describes the organization of the project, roles and responsibilities of 
      	  the participants, and top level development process for the project. The 
      	  JDT and PDE are plug-in tools for the Eclipse Platform. Together, these 
      	  three pieces form the Eclipse SDK <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/" target="_top">download</a>, 
      	  a complete development environment for Eclipse-based tools, and for developing 
      	  Eclipse itself.

		          <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform" target="_top">Platform</a><br/>
				      The Platform defines the set of frameworks and common services that collectively 
				      make up &quot;integration-ware&quot; required to support the use of Eclipse 
				      as a component model, as a rich client platform (<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Rich_Client_Platform" target="_top">RCP</a>) 
				      and as a comprehensive tool integration platform. These services and frameworks 
				      include a standard workbench user interface model and portable native widget 
				      toolkit, a project model for managing resources, automatic resource delta 
				      management for incremental compilers and builders, language-independent 
				      debug infrastructure, and infrastructure for distributed multi-user versioned 
				      resource management.
		        </li>
		        <li> 
		          <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/" target="_top">JDT - Java development tools</a><br>
				      The JDT provides the tool plug-ins for the platform that implement a Java 
				      IDE for power-users, that supports the development of any Java application, 
				      including Eclipse plug-ins. The JDT adds the notion of Java projects and 
				      a Java perspective to the Eclipse platform, as well as a number of views, 
				      editors, wizards, builders, and code merging and refactoring tools. The 
				      JDT allows Eclipse to be a development environment for itself. The JDT plug-ins 
				      themselves can also be further extended by other tool builders.
		        </li>
		        <li> 
		          <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/pde/" target="_top">PDE - Plug-in development environment</a><br>
				      The PDE project provides a number of views and editors that make is easier 
				      to build plug-ins for Eclipse. Using the PDE, you can create your plug-in 
				      manifest file (plugin.xml), specify your plug-in runtime and other required 
				      plug-ins, define extension points, including their specific markup, associate 
				      XML Schema files with the extension point markup so extensions can be validated, 
				      create extensions on other plug-in extension points, etc. The PDE makes 
				      integrating plug-ins easy and fun.
		        </li>
		        <li> 
		          <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/e4/" target="_top">e4 - the next generation of the Eclipse platform</a><br>
				      The e4 project is an incubator for developing the next generation
				      of the Eclipse platform. The mission of the e4 project is to build a next 
				      generation platform for pervasive, component-based applications and tools.<br>
