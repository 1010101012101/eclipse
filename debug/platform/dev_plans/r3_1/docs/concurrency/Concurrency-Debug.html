<h1>Concurrency in the Debug Platform</h1>
<p>Last revised: Nov 26, 2004. Author: Darin Wright.</p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Many debug architectures require communicating with a remote debug target. 
  The debug user interface needs to be robust in the face of latent and unreliable 
  connections. To avoid blocking the user interface, the debug platform is exploiting 
  the use of background jobs to perform operations and communicate with debuggers. 
  As the opportunity for concurrent requests against debuggers increases, the 
  platform must provide support for serializing conflicting requests against debuggers 
  - for example a read operation to render a stack frame and a request that would 
  invalidate the stack frame by resuming its thread. The debug platform needs 
  to provide API and a set of guidelines to follow when scheduling concurrent 
  operations and requests against debuggers.</p>
<h2>Proposal</h2>
<h3>The classic cuncurrency issues</h3>
<p>There are similarities between resources and debug elements and between resource 
  modification and and performing operations on debug elements. Both are hierarchical 
  in nature: a project contains folders and files, a debug target contains threads 
  and stack frames. To support concurrent operations on resources care must be 
  taken to properly lock the appropriate resources for updates. To properly support 
  concurrent operations on debug elements, a similar locking scheme should be 
  used. For example, in order to write to a file, a lock must be obtained on that 
  resource. In order to step in a thread, a lock should be obtained on the thread.</p>
<h3>Using the platform pattern</h3>
<p>The resource platform uses scheduling rules to achieve resource locking, via 
  a rule factory that generates rules for different types of operations. Similarly, 
  the debug platform could provide a rule factory to create scheduling rules for 
  operations on debug elements. There are two basic types of operations that can 
  be performed on a debug element: <b>access</b> operations and <b>modify</b> 
  operations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An access operation simply reads or accesses data from a debug element. 
    Generally, concurrent accesses may be supported by a debug architecture, unless 
    the architecture only allows for serialized requests to the remote target.</li>
  <li>A modify operation changes the state of a debug element. Generally, only 
    one modify operations cannot be performed concurrently. However, the rules 
    may be different in different architectures. For example, the Java debugger 
    allows for step operations to be performed in different threads at the same 
    time, where as other architectures only allow stepping in one thread.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Specializing concurrency support</h3>
<p>Since different architectures may have different concurrency capabilities, 
  the rules for performing concurrent operations must be provided by the architecture. 
  The debug platform can provide a pessimistic rule factory as a default implementation 
  for targets that do not provide their own rule factory. Debuggers that want 
  to leverage extra concurrency must provide their own rule factory. The pessimistic 
  rule factory would provide rules for serialized modify and access operations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A rule factory can be provided using the platform's adapter mechanism. For 
    example, an <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">IDebugRuleFactory</font> 
    adapter can be provided by an <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">IDebugTarget</font></li>
</ul>
<h3>What does it mean to the debug platform?</h3>
<p>The debug platform's actions that modify and access debug elements should do 
  so using the appropriate scheduling rules. Note that the use of scheduling rules 
  does not mean that jobs have to be used. For example, one can simply use the 
  beginRule/endRule support on the job manager. An operation would consult a debug 
  target's rule factory to obtain the appropriate rule. For example, a step operation 
  on a stack frame would obtain the modify rule for the stack frame, and schedule 
  a job to perform the step.</p>
<h3>What does it mean to the debug implementor?</h3>
<p>To maintain backwards compatibility, debug implementations are not required 
  to do anything to work in the 3.1 debug platform. By default, a rule factory 
  will be provided that serializes access and modification operations. To enable 
  concurrent operations, a debugger can provide its own rule factory. For example 
  the Java debugger would provide a rule factory to allow concurrent access operations 
  within a debug target, and allow concurrent modification operations in different 
  threads.</p>
<p>Debug models may use scheduling rules within their implementations, so that 
  clients calling debug model APIs are enforced to use the proper rules. For example, 
  the step implementation would use beginRule/endRule calls to the job manager 
  when performing a step.</p>
<h3>Why do we need this?</h3>
<p>As we add perform more background operations in the debugger, and move communication 
  out of the UI thread to the background, we need a mechanism so support concurrent 
  operations on debuggers, and we have to let debuggers tell us what the concurrency 
  rules are for their architectures.</p>
<p>For example, in a step operation the following sequence of events occurs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The step action initiates a step request on a stack frame (or its owning 
    thread)</li>
  <li>A RESUME/STEP_OVER event is fired</li>
  <li>A timer is started in case the step takes longer than 500ms, in which case 
    the debug view is updated to show a long running step.</li>
  <li>A SUSPEND/STEP_END event is fired</li>
  <li>The timer is canceled.</li>
  <li>The debug view refreshes, updating the thread label, and accessing the new 
    stack frames in the thread.</li>
  <li>The variables view refreshes, accessing the variables in the stack frame 
    and children of any expanded variables. This may require evaluations to compute 
    logical structures. An evaluation may be performed to compute variable toString() 
    values in the details pane, or in line in the variables view, depending on 
    how the view is configured.</li>
  <li>Source lookup is performed on the top stack frame, and an editor is opened. 
    Source lookup accesses the debug model to resolve a source name for a stack 
    frame. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the 3.1 debug platform the step request will be performed in a background 
  job. As well, the debug and variables view content providers will retrieve content 
  and generate labels in background jobs. Source lookup will also be performed 
  in a background job. All of this is done to avoid blocking the UI thread while 
  communicating with a debug target. As updating the variables view can trigger 
  evaluations (effectively resuming the thread that has just suspended to compute 
  toString()'s), this can interfere with rendering labels in the debug view, as 
  it invalidates stack frames. As well, the step action re-enables when the step 
  end event is received, allowing the user to initiate another step before the 
  views update. This can cause the views to show partial information, and information 
  in an error state as the thread resumes while labels are being generated. We 
  either want all views to update before we allow another step to occur (via serialization 
  of jobs), or allow the next step request to effectively cancel jobs that it 
  makes obsolete. We may be able to leverage the shouldSchedule/shouldRun support 
  in jobs to cancel jobs that are obsolete.</p>
<h3>Findings</h3>
<p>Last updated: Dec 3, 2004</p>
<p>Experimenting with a rule factory that clients can use to perform locking when 
  communicating with (accessing and modifying) a debugger revealed the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The potential for deadlock increases. Debug model implementations may already 
    use Java's built-in synchronization to implement thread safety. The additional 
    use of scheduling rules as locks increases the chance of deadlocks in the 
    following scenario: a debug element obtains a VM lock on an object, and performs 
    a function that eventually requires a scheduling rule lock while another thread 
    holds the scheduling rule lock, and is waiting for the VM lock. This could 
    be avoided if the same locking mechanism were used by the client and implementation, 
    but that would require debug model implementations to change and publicize 
    their locking implementation.</li>
  <li>Using the scheduling rule locks is expensive. Each access to a debug model 
    would require the use of an access lock. Thus, simple operations take on larger 
    overhead. For example, generating a label would require the following steps, 
    which will have a performance impact. 
    <ul>
      <li>retrieving the debug rule factory adapter for a debug element</li>
      <li>getting an access scheduling rule from the factory for the element</li>
      <li>locking on the rule</li>
      <li>computing the label</li>
      <li>releasing the lock</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The client doesn't know when a lock is required. Requiring the use of locks 
    is aggressive, and will no doubt cause locking when no locks are needed. Debug 
    model implementations often cache information in the model to avoid communication 
    with the back end (for example element names, etc.). Thus, clients will perform 
    locking, when the implementation doesn't require it. Only the implementation 
    knows when a lock is required.</li>
  <li>Client code becomes more complex. Although I was able to reduce the code 
    pattern to a simple try/finally block with a getLock(..) and releaseLock(..) 
    method, code interacting with a debug model grows more complex, and harder 
    to maintain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these findings, we believe it is up to debug model implementations 
  to assure they are thread safe, performing their own synchronization as needed. 
  Models that require serialized communication with a back end are also required 
  to implement such behavior in their model. In terms of API, this is not a breaking 
  change. In terms of behavior, it is a change that may expose concurrency issues 
  in existing debug model implementations. Debug model implementations need to 
  ensure they are thread safe.</p>
