<h1>Launch Alternatives</h1>
<p>This document describes some of the alternatives that have been considered 
  for the launch configurations dialog that exists in Eclispe 3.0 and prior.</p>
<p>The usability problems with the launch configruations dialog to be considered 
  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Confusing and intimidating to novice users. When confronted with the dialog, 
    users do not know what to do. The terminology is also intimidating and ambiguous 
    - i.e. &quot;create, manage, and run configurations&quot;. The user does not 
    know what a &quot;configuration&quot; is.</li>
  <li>Scalability issues in regards to the number of lanuch configurations types 
    and launch configuration instances. The tree on the left hand side of the 
    dialog can get large quickly.</li>
  <li>Making the &quot;copy/duplicate&quot; function more visible. The dialog 
    only presents &quot;new&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; buttons. The &quot;duplciate&quot; 
    action is hidden in the context menu of the tree (since there is not enough 
    screen realestate to show the button at the bottom of the tree).</li>
  <li>Consider the introdcution of launch config inheritance/templates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Launch Wizard</h2>
<p>To make the launch process less intimidating, a launch wizard has been considered. 
  Two pages are presented. The first page allows the user to select the application 
  to run, and the second allows them to configure the application. The user can 
  launch from the first page of the wizard by pressing &quot;Run&quot; (the Finish 
  button).</p>

  <img src="launch-wiz-p2.JPG" width="555" height="609"> </p>
<p>The benefits of this solution:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The wizard is less intimidating. The first page of the wizard tells the 
    user what to do - &quot;select or configure an application to run&quot;. As 
    the user selects different types of applications the message changes with 
    a description of the appliaction type - for example, &quot;Run a Java application&quot;. 
    The terminology of &quot;application&quot; is more descriptive than &quot;launch 
    configuration&quot;. </li>
  <li>There is room for a &quot;Copy&quot; button on the first page of the wizard.</li>
  <li>The second page of the wizard has an application type specific banner image 
    (just a polish item really)</li>
</ul>
<p>The drawbacks of this solution:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Copying attributes between configurations or moving from configuration to 
    configuration becomes more tedious, as the user must go back and forth between 
    the pages to move betwen configurations.</li>
  <li>Non-standard buttons to enable single-click &quot;new&quot; and &quot;copy&quot; 
    operations (i.e. create a new config and advance to the next page automatically).</li>
</ul>
