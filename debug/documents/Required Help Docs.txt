Required help topics

Stuff to consider:

A. ensure open dialog text is Open <bold>dialog name</bold> Dialog

B. run a command text is <bold>command name</bold>....

C. remove lines from under the title and from above the concepts links section

D. check order of related concepts in help matrix, i.e. view help should be first in listing of related concepts in context help

E. Evaluations? Concepts? force early return? Already some info in Evaluating Expressions reference page

F. References/Instances concepts?

G. Reference pages for Commands 

	The reference page for a command should be done as follows:
	Title/Header should be: <cmd name> (may include the context, i.e. Enable Breakpoint vs Enable)
	First sentence should be Select the <cmd label> command [ <icon> ] to <function>.  (label is what the user sees)
	Links: Should link to the view it is in.
	Name the file:  ref-<name>_[viewaction, contextaction or menuaction]
	If the command is shared, have a list "This command applies to:" with links to the views
	If the command is not shared, have link to the view in the list of related reference
	Commands with no icon in the context menus need a screen shot

H. Reference pages for Options (from Property Pages)

	The reference page for an option should be done as follows:
	Title/Header should be: <context> <opt name> (i.e. Watchpoint Field Access)
	First sentence should be Select the <opt label> option to <function>.  (label is what the user sees)
	Links: Should link to the property page it is in.
	Name the file: ref-<opt name>_option

I. For screenshots

	No borders
	Must have alt text
	To highlight a menu option, hover the mouse over it (background should be blue)
	To highlight a control, such as a checkbox on a pref page, surround the option with a red rectangle of line thickness 2 in paint
	In a pref/prop page, every option that can be checked should be unchecked

J. Do icon images have to be converted from .gif to .png by us?

	- link with information on evaluations
	- link with inspect popup dialog help (if added)
	- link with expression view

MAJOR TODOS: 

1. Developer tools wiki
	- root wiki, leading to other wikis about developing with and for the 
	  debugger, including lots of code snippets and discussions

LINK AND OTHER MINOR CHANGES:

1. Edit Launch configuration command (debug) reference page
	- Link to the edit launch config dialog help page
	
2. Edit source lookup command (debug) reference page
	- Link to the edit source lookup dialog help page
	
3. Command pages associated with step filtering (edit step filter, filter type, filter package)
	- Link to the task/concept of step filtering, or the preference page help
	
4. Open Declared Type Hierarchy View (debug) reference page
	- It would be cool to be able to link to the help for the Type Hierarchy View
	
5. Debug Target Properties (debug) reference page
	- Make sure it is in the same style as other open property page help
	- Link to the property page help
	
6. Use Step Filters (debug) reference page
	- Link to the task/concept of step filtering, or the preference page help
	
7. Display view content assist (display) reference page
	- Link to content assist and other related pages from JDT
	
8. Display Result (display) reference page
	- Link to evaluation concept page
	
9. Group By (Breakpoints) view action reference page
	- if advanced dialog gets own page, this needs a link, related references are not links
	
15. Add Watch Expression and Edit Watch Expression (expression) commands reference page
	- Should be linked with the help of the dialog they create
	
18. Expressions View Preferences (expressions) command help
	- maybe make a shared page with the variables view
	- needs a new screenshot
	
21. Create Watch Expression (variables) command help
	- link to expression concept or info on evaluations
	
24. Add/Remove Watchpoint (variables) command help
	- needs work and lots of links
	- is this same as something in the expressions/shared?
