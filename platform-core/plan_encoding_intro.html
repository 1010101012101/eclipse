<h1>Non-uniform file encodings in the Eclipse Platform</h1>
  <p><font size="-1">Last modified: June 9, 2003</font> </p>
  <cite><strong>Plan item description:</strong> Eclipse 2.1 uses 
    a single global file encoding setting for reading and writing files in the 
    workspace. This is problematic; for example, when Java source files in the 
    workspace use OS default file encoding while XML files in the workspace use 
    UTF-8 file encoding. The Platform should support non-uniform file encodings. 
    [Platform Core, Platform UI, Text, Search, Compare, JDT UI, JDT Core] [Theme: 
    User experience] (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37933">37933</a>, 
    <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=5399">5399</a>) </cite>
<p>The current situation is as follows:
<ul>
<li><code>ResourcesPlugin.getEncoding</code> returns the default encoding for the 
  workspace (the <code>org.eclipse.core.resources.encoding</code> preference value 
  if available, otherwise the value of the <code>file.encoding</code> Java system 
  property).</li>
<li><code>IFile.getContents</code>/<code>setContents</code> work with byte streams 
  - no encoding can be applied.</li>
<li><code>IFile.getEncoding</code> tries to guess the file encoding (looking for 
  the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/faq/utf_bom.html">Byte Order Mark</a>), 
  which is not enough. Also, this API has no known client (Eclipse/WSAD) so far. 
  This API method would be deprecated.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>users should be able to set the encoding for a file or a default encoding 
    for a container (folders, projects, the workspace root) and its children.</li>
  <li>users should be able to share encoding settings in a team repository (metadata 
    should reside in the project content area).</li>
  <li>file-specific encoding setting prevails upon file contents-based encoding.</li>
  <li>file contents-based encoding prevails upon the inherited 
    encoding setting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proposed solution</h2>
<p>Following is the basic algorithm proposed for determining a file's encoding: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>the file had its encoding explicitly set (<code>IFile.setCharset</code> 
    - not <code>setEncoding</code> because of the existing method).</li>
  <li>the file encoding can be guessed by its contents (Byte Order Mark).</li>
  <li>the file encoding can be guessed by the <em>encoding interpreter</em> associated 
    to its file extension (if it has a known extension).</li>
  <li>a direct/indirect parent container had its encoding explicitly set</li>
  <li>otherwise, the file encoding is the same as the workspace (workspace root's encoding == <code>ResourcesPlugin.getEncoding</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding step 3, an extension-point would allow file format-aware encoding 
  interpreters to register to the encoding discovery mechanism for specific file 
  types (extensions). Users would be able to associate more file extensions for 
  the known interpreters (preference).</p>
<p>All clients, when creating character-based streams from the result of <code>IFile.getContents</code>, 
  should pass along the charset string obtained from <code>IFile.getCharset</code> 
  instead of the one provided by <code>ResourcesPlugin.getEncoding</code>. Examples 
  are: text editors, compiler, search, compare.</p>
<p>Also, setting the encoding for a resource could generate a resource change 
  event, but only for the directly affected resource (if clients are interested 
  on what effects the change in a directory had on files inside it, they will 
  have to find it out by themselves). </p>
<h3>API changes</h3>
<h4>Added:</h4>
<p><code>public void IResource.setCharset(String charsetName) throws CoreException</code></p>
<p>Sets the charset name for this resource. May be <code>null</code>, which sets 
  it to default. For the workspace root, it sets the workspace's default encoding 
  preference to the charset's canonical name (or to the default encoding, if <code>null</code> 
  was provided). </p>
<p><code>public String IResource.getCharset() throws CoreException</code></p>
<p>Returns the name of the charset for this resource. For files, if none has been 
  defined (with <code>setCharset</code>), returns the default charset. To determine 
  the default charset, it tries to guess it by a) inspecting the file contents 
  (BOM), b) calling the corresponding encoding interpreter (if any). Otherwise, 
  the parent's charset is returned. For the workspace root, a charset corresponding 
  to the workspace's default encoding preference is returned.</p>
<p><code>public boolean IResource.isDefaultCharset() throws CoreException</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>true</code> if the currently configured charset is set by the 
  user or has a default value (either guessed by file contents, or inherited from 
  parent).</p>
<p><code>public static final int IResourceDelta.ENCODING = 0x100000;</code></p>
<p><code>public String IResourceDelta.getNewCharset();</code></p>
<p><code>public String IResourceDelta.getOldCharset();</code></p>
<p>For notifying changes in file encodings. Both methods should only be called 
  only valid when <code>getKind()==CHANGE</code>, and <code>(getFlags()&amp;ENCODING)!=0</code>.</p>
<pre>public interface IEncodingInterpreter {
	/** returns null if the charset cannot be determined. */
	public String interpretCharset(java.io.InputStream input);
}</pre>
<p>Encoding interpreters will be associated to file types through a new core resources 
  extension point. Users can associate additional file extensions ia preferences.</p>
<p>The core resources plug-in would provide itself implementations for text, xml 
  and html files.</p>
<h4>Deprecated:</h4>
<pre>public int IFile.getEncoding()
public int IFile.ENCODING_* constants</pre>
<h3>Scenarios</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The user gets the source code for a set of classes it needs to use, but 
    the classes do not compile because the author used internal Java identifiers 
    not supported in the user workspace's current encoding. The user then selects 
    the offending source files, and apply to them the correct encoding. The encoding 
    change in the affected files will be reported in subsequent resource change 
    events (to listeners and builders). Editors/views that have such files open 
    may decide to reload the contents using the new encoding. Builders may recompute 
    build state affected by changed encodings.</li>
  <li> If the user changes the encoding for a bunch of directories, only the directly 
    affected resources will appear in the delta. Clients may want to re-read/re-build 
    the contents of files whose parent changed encoding.</li>
  <li>The user opens in an editor a text file whose contents where created using 
    encoding &quot;MS932&quot; in a workspace whose default encoding is &quot;US-ASCII&quot;. 
    It was not possible to guess the file encoding automatically, so what the 
    user sees is gibberish. The user figures out the cause of the problem and 
    expliclty sets the encoding for that specific file to be &quot;MS932&quot;. 
    The editor might offer to the user the option of reloading the file's contents.</li>
  <li>The user moves a text file with default encoding to a directory which has 
    a different encoding than the previous parent (which means the encoding for 
    the file has changed). No encoding changes will be reported. Clients may want 
    to re-read the file when it is moved if it reports a different encoding than 
    the one originally used to load its contents.</li>
</ul>
