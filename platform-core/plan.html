      <p><b>Current Work</b> </p>
      <p>Work will now be focused on Eclipse 3.0. Rather than rolling out version 
        2.2 which would contain fixes and minor feature requests, it has been 
        decided that we will take on more challenging problems. Please read <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/why_eclipse_3_0.html">Why 
        Eclipse &quot;3.0&quot;?</a> and the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_0.html">Eclipse 
        3.0 Project Plan</a>.</p>
      <p>Being done concurrently with the 3.0 work are bug fixes for service releases 
        for Eclipse 2.1. For a list of problems which will be fixed for the Eclipse 
        2.1.1 release, check out the Bugzilla bug reports by clicking <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&product=Platform&component=Core&target_milestone=2.1.1&long_desc_type=allwordssubstr&long_desc=&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc=&keywords_type=allwords&keywords=&emailtype1=substring&email1=&emailtype2=substring&email2=&bugidtype=include&bug_id=&votes=&changedin=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&cmdtype=doit&namedcmd=core-3.0&newqueryname=&order=Reuse%2Bsame%2Bsort%2Bas%2Blast%2Btime&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=">here</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Major work items</b></p>
      <p><i><a href="plan_details.html">Concurrency/Background Operations</a></i> 
        - One of the biggest complaints about Eclipse is that almost every user 
        action locks the system for the duration of the operation. When you save 
        a Java file you have to wait for the compiler to finish before you do 
        anything, when you load a project from CVS you have to wait until it completes 
        before you can edit code, etc. The limitations of the current model are 
        increasingly evident in the context of the Rich Client Platform (RCP). 
      </p>
      <p><i><a href="plan_details.html">Dynamic Plug-ins</a></i> - The current 
        Eclipse plug-in activation story is &quot;somewhat less than optimal&quot;. 
        Plug-ins are automatically activated upon first reference and once a plug-in 
        is started, it remains in that state for the duration of the Eclipse session. 
        We would like to migrate to a model which would allow for plug-ins to 
        be activated and de-activated within the same session. As well, when a 
        user installs a new plug-in to their configuration, they must restart 
        Eclipse in order for their changes to take effect. As part of the dynamic 
        plug-in work, we are also investigating incremental registry resolution 
        which means that users won't require a restart for new plug-in changes 
        to take effect.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><i><a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-vcm-home/docs/online/team3.0/resources.html">Team/Resource 
        Integration</a></i> - There currently exists a few hooks in the core code 
        which allow Team providers the opportunity to perform operations on resources 
        before/instead of the core default. We wish to allow for a pluggable mechanism 
        which provides more control over these operations. Check out the document 
        link for a good description of this problem on the Platform/Team web page.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><i><a href="plan_details.html">Improve User Experience</a></i> - As a 
        first-time Eclipse user there are many non-obvious problems that you can 
        run across and this plan item is being used to collect them all. Some 
        current problems include (but are not limited to): default location of 
        the workspace, separation of user settings and plug-in metadata, multiple 
        workspaces, and translation of messages presented to the user from the 
        Eclipse executable.</p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p><i><a href="plan_details.html">Remove Xerces Dependancy </a></i>- The 
        Eclipse SDK is shipped with a Xerces implementation which is approximately 
        3M in size. (source and binaries) This gets interesting as we move towards 
        supporting a Rich Client Platform (RCP) and have applications which are 
        interested in using minimal installs of Eclipse and perhaps even running 
        Eclipse headless. In these cases 3M is a large percentage of the Eclipse 
        base that they are using. In an effort to reduce the size of the standard 
        Eclipse components required and to increase performance (speed) and size 
        (memory), we are investigating removing our dependancy on the Xerces plug-in 
        and instead including a light-weight, fast XML parser such as one based 
        on the XMLPull technology.<br>
      </p>
      <p><i><a href="plan_details.html">Improve File Encoding Support </a></i>- 
        Eclipse 2.1 uses a single global file encoding setting for reading and 
        writing files in the workspace. This is problematic; for example, when 
        Java source files in the workspace use OS default file encoding while 
        XML files in the workspace use UTF-8 file encoding. The Platform should 
        support non-uniform file encodings.</p>
