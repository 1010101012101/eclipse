      <p>Work will now be focused on Eclipse 3.0. Rather than rolling out version 
        2.2 which would contain fixes and minor feature requests, it has been 
        decided that we will take on more challenging problems. Please read <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/why_eclipse_3_0.html">Why

        3.0 Project Plan</a>.</p>
      <p>Being done concurrently with the 3.0 work are bug fixes for service releases 
        for Eclipse 2.1. For a list of problems which will be fixed for the Eclipse 
        2.1.1 release, check out the Bugzilla bug reports by clicking <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&product=Platform&component=Core&target_milestone=2.1.1&long_desc_type=allwordssubstr&long_desc=&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc=&keywords_type=allwords&keywords=&emailtype1=substring&email1=&emailtype2=substring&email2=&bugidtype=include&bug_id=&votes=&changedin=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&cmdtype=doit&namedcmd=core-3.0&newqueryname=&order=Reuse%2Bsame%2Bsort%2Bas%2Blast%2Btime&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=">here</a>.</p>

      <p>[plan item] <i>Improve file encoding support</i> - Eclipse 2.1 uses a 
        single global file encoding setting for reading and writing files in the 
        workspace. This is problematic; for example, when Java source files in 
        the workspace use OS default file encoding while XML files in the workspace 
        use UTF-8 file encoding. The Platform should support non-uniform file 
        encodings. [Platform Core, Platform UI, Text, Search, Compare, JDT UI,

      <p>[plan item] <i><a href="plan_concurrency.html">Support concurrent activities</a></i> 
        - In Eclipse 2.0 and 2.1, certain operations like builds and searches 
        always run synchronously and block the user at the UI from doing work 
        until the build has completed. The Eclipse Platform should support operations 
        running asynchronously in the background, so that the user is not forced 
        to be entirely idle while long-running operations are in progress. This 
        will likely require an improved concurrency architecture with more explicit 
        rules. [Platform UI, Platform Core, Platform Text, JDT Core, JDT UI, PDE]

      <p>[plan item] <i>Enable Eclipse to be used as a rich client platform</i> 
        - Eclipse was designed as a universal tool integration platform. However, 
        many facets and components of Eclipse are not particularly specific to 
        IDEs and would make equal sense in non-IDE applications (e.g., window-based 
        GUI, plug-ins, help system, update manager). The Eclipse Platform should 
        factor out and segregate IDE-specific facilities (e.g., everything having 
        to do with workspace resources) so that a subset of it can be used as 
        a rich client platform for building applications. [Platform Core, Platform

        user settings (preferences, compiler settings, repositories lists, etc.)

      <p>[plan item] <i>Allow editors to open files outside workspace</i> - A 
        common request is to be able to use Eclipse to open a file that is not 
        part of the workspace, or perhaps even one on a remote system. In addition, 
        applications would like to provide file extension associations so that 
        double-clicking on a file in the OS desktop would open the associated 
        Eclipse editor. The operations and capabilities available on these &quot;outside 
        of the workspace&quot; files would need to be defined. [Platform UI] [Themes:

      <p>[plan item] <i>Improve workspace synchronization with file system</i> 
        - A file resource in the workspace gets out of sync when the underlying 
        file in the file system is created, deleted, or rewritten outside of Eclipse. 
        File resources usually remains out of sync until the user explicitly hits 
        Refresh. The Eclipse Platform should provide ways to keep the in-memory 
        representation in sync with the file system; for example, by hooking OS 
        file system callbacks where available, and by polling for file system 
        changes in a background thread. [Platform Core, Platform UI] [Theme: User

      <p>[plan item] <i>Content-type-based editor lookup</i> - The choice of editor 
        is currently based on file name patterns. This is not very flexible, and 
        breaks down when fundamentally different types of content are found in 
        files with undistinguished file names or internal formats. For example, 
        many different models with specialized editors get stored in XML format 
        files named *.xml. Eclipse should support a notion of content type for 
        files and resources, and use these to drive decisions like which editor 
        to use. This feature would also be used by team providers when doing comparisons 
        based on file type. The several existing file-type registries in Eclipse 
        should be consolidated. [Platform Core, Platform UI] [Theme: User experience] 
        (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37668">37668</a>)</p>
      <p>[plan item] <i>Improve support for opening workspaces</i> - Many users 
        use multiple workspaces as a way to keep their different projects or work 
        items separate. Currently, this requires launching Eclipse multiple times 
        with different command line arguments, which is not particularly convenient 
        for users. Moreover, when the command line argument is not specified, 
        the workspace location defaults to a directory inside where the code for 
        Eclipse is installed. Eclipse should improve how workspaces get opened, 
        use a user-specific default workspace location more suitable for shared 
        multi-user Eclipse installs, and facilitate switching between workspaces.

        [plan item] <i><a href="plan_dynamic_plugins.html">Support adding and 
        removing plug-ins dynamically</a></i> - Installation and configuration 
        of features and plug-ins currently only happens during Eclipse Platform 
        startup. The plug-in registry should be made dynamic so that features 
        and plug-ins can be added or removed without necessarily having to restart 
        Eclipse. This will also entail adding mechanisms for handling the arrival 
        and departure of extensions and extension points. Additional mechanisms 
        such as services will be added to support the dynamic programming model. 
        Alternative runtimes (e.g., OSGi) which offer explicit support for dynamic 
        components will also be investigated and used as appropriate. Plug-in 
        developers will likely require additional support from PDE in writing 
        and debugging well-behaved dynamic plug-ins. [Platform Core, PDE] [Theme: 
        Rich client platform] (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37687">37687</a>)</p>
      <p>[plan item] <i><a href="plan_dynamic_plugins.html">Allow plug-in deactivation</a></i> 
        - In order to scale to a large number of plug-ins, Eclipse does not activate 
        a plug-in until its code is actually needed. However, once activated a 
        plug-in remains active for the remainder of the session. Unfortunately, 
        this means that an active plug-in will occupy memory space for its code 
        and objects even if it is only used occasionally. Many users have sessions 
        lasting days or weeks, and this bloat taxes processor memory and JVM performance. 
        The analogy is a long play where the actors enter the stage on cue, but 
        cannot leave it until the play is over. The Eclipse Platform should support 
        plug-ins that can be safely deactivated when the user needs to recover 
        valuable memory space. Another alternative is to provide a way to quietly 
        shutdown and restart the Platform. [Platform Core, Platform UI] [Theme:

        <br>
        [plan item] <i>Add a security model</i> - Security needs are pervasive. 
        The Eclipse Platform should provide the basic framework for a security 
        mechanism that can be used by all plug-ins, including a simple credentials 
        store and user authentication. Additionally, key parts of the Platform 
        itself should be secured, such as the ability to install plug-ins, which 
        might need to be restricted in certain products or for certain users.

      <p>[plan item] <i><a href="plan_team_integration.html">Improve team control 
        over resource operations</a></i> - Eclipse currently provides limited 
        hooks (edit/save, move/delete) so that team providers can control or influence 
        operations on resources in the workspace. However, there are some aspects 
        and operations over which team providers have little or no influence, 
        such as resource creation and copying. Eclipse should offer team providers 
        better control over resource operations. [Platform Core, Platform Team] 
        (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37722">37722</a>)</p>
      <p>[plan item] <i>Support logical resources</i> - The Eclipse Platform supports 
        a strong physical view of projects, files, and folders in the workspace. 
        However, there are many situations where a physical view is not the most 
        salient or useful for many purposes. In some cases, multiple distinct 
        objects happen to be stored in a single file, like an archive. Conversely, 
        in other cases, something that is logically a single object is stored 
        across multiple files. This discrepancy between logical and physical creates 
        problems for common operations such as searching, comparing, and versioning, 
        which need to work in the physical realm. Eclipse should support some 
        way of mapping between a logical view and the physical organization of 
        files on disk. [Platform Core, Platform UI] (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37723">37723</a>)<br>

        </a>- The Xerces plug-in currently provides XML support for the Eclipse 
        platform. XML support is now incorporated into J2SE 1.4, and the presence
