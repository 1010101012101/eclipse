      <p><b>Milestone Plans</b> </p>
      <p><a name="Milestone_Planning"></a><em>Milestone 1 (2.1 M1)</em> - September 
        20, 2002</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The rigid structure of projects in Eclipse is a problem with a lot 
          of users' existing project layouts. See <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=6664">bug 
          6664</a> for more information. For this milestone we would like to have 
          a proposal ready and posted to this web space for comment by the open 
          source community. Once posted, comments should be sent to the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/platform-core-dev">platform-core-dev@eclipse.org</a> 
          mailing list. <i>Note: this item has been pushed back to M2 with the 
          creation of a new team to address the problem. See below for details.</i> 
        </li>
        <li>Work towards building tools which will help with crash recovery and 
          analysis of metadata files on disk.</li>
        <li>General bug fixing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Milestone 2 (2.1 M2)</em> - October 18, 2002</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Progress on the project structure problem has been made. A dynamic 
          team has been formed and a "Problem Definition" document has been <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/inflexible-projects-problem.html">posted</a> 
          to eclipse.org. The goal for M2 is to have the proposal (including solution) 
          finalized and posted.</li>
        <li>Continued work on tools and examples. Check the <a href="dev.html">Development 
          Resources</a> for progress...tools plug-ins will be posted there.</li>
        <li>General bug fixing and triage work on backlog of bugs in the Inbox.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Milestone 3 (2.1 M3)</em> - November 15, 2002</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Project Structure - You've seen the links to the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/inflexible-projects-problem.html">problem 
          definition</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/towards-more-flexible-projects.html">possible 
          solutions</a>. A third document with the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/flexible-projects-proposal.html">proposed 
          solution</a> is now posted. The specific Platform/Core required work 
          for M3 includes: 
          <ul>
            <li>new API for creating links to files and folders 
            <li>javadoc changes to existing API (copy/move/delete) 
            <li>ammended Natures doc - adding new attribute for veto-power 
            <li>new API for workspace path variables to be used with linked resources 
            <li>new Team hook for link veto-power 
            <li>new API for mapping from a file-system location to workspace resource(s), 
              and vice versa 
          </ul>
        <li>Circular Build Dependancies - A dynamic team to address this problem 
          has been created. The work required for the Platform/Core team for the 
          M3 milestone consists of new API for computing the default project build 
          order and a new algorithm for calculating the build order when there 
          are cycles involved. (related bugs: <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25952">25952</a>, 
          <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=10262">10262</a>) 
        <li>Features - A dynamic team consisting of Dean, Jeff, Dejan, Christophe, 
          and DJ has been created to address all the problems that the Release 
          Engineering team has with features. Once an appropriate solution has 
          been identified, there will be significant work in the PDE-Build component 
          (which is owned by Platform/Core) for both the M3 and M4 milestones. 
        <li>General Bug Fixing. 
      </ul>
      <p><em>Milestone 4 (2.1 M4)</em> - December 13, 2002</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Project Structures - Finish up work related to flexible project layout. 
          List includes multi-resource delta notification for over-lapping linked 
          resources. (related bugs: <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25993">25993</a>) 
        <li>Classloader Performance - In M2 we put in a classloader performance 
          enhancement in which the plug-in classloader used information in a file 
          to determine whether or not it should look in itself for a particular 
          class. We want to allow users to put this information in the mark-up 
          in their plugin.xml files. (related bugs: <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=24667">24667</a> 
          , <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26011">26011</a>) 
        <li>Continued progress on PDE-Build in the space related to the Features 
          dynamic team. 
        <li>New feature to allow local history to persist across certain refactoring 
          actions. (related bug: <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=24787">24787</a>)

    <td><b>Test Plans</b> 
	  <blockquote> 
        <p><b>Testing RC1</b> : When testing, we should specifically focus on 
          areas which we have changed at the Platform/Core level since the last 
          release. Some of these include:</p>
		  
		  
        <ul>
          <li><b>Linked Resources</b> : Users are now able to create first-level 
            children (both files and folders) of a project and point them to any 
            location on the file system. This removes the big requirement that 
            we used to have of projects having to be rooted at a single point 
            on disk.</li>
          <li><b>Path Variables</b> : Workbench -> Preferences -> Workbench -> 
            Path Variables. This preference page allows the user to create path 
            variables and these then in turn can be used when creating linked 
            resources. (see above) The path variables are stored in the preference 
            store which means we can test all the usual suspects such as bogus 
            values in the file, file corruption, etc etc.</li>
          <li><b>DBCS</b> : A new core library was released which improved support 
            for double-byte characters in file and path names. </li>
          <li><b>Improved Delete Failure</b> : When problems occur during deletion, 
            the tree that you are deleting should be pruned as best it can and 
            then the errors are reported to the user.</li>
          <li><b>Moving History</b> : When moving a resource to a different location 
            in the workspace tree, the local history is now carried with it to 
            the destination. </li>
          <li><b>Circular Dependancies</b> : Improved support has been added for 
            building workspaces containing projects with circular dependancies.</li>
          <li><b>Performance</b> : Many improvments have been made in the area 
            of performance. We need to ensure that (1) we are faster and smaller 
            than we used to be and (2) people are taking advantage of the benefits 
            that we offer them. This includes inspecting other teams' code in 
            the SDK to ensure that they are, for instance, using the resource 
            proxy visitor when they can.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> It's also important that when we test we have all the "bells and whistles" 
          activated in our development images. Some features (like decorators) 
          run in a separate thread and it's important that we ensure our code 
          is thread safe and we don't have any concurrent access or deadlock problems.
