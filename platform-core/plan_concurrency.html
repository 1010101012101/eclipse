      <p><i>Workspace Lock Granularity</i> - Currently the Eclipse resource model 
        locks the entire workspace for the duration of any workspace modifying 
        operations. This approach does not lend itself to concurrent operations. 
        We would like to have a different approach which allows locking to occur 
        on a per resource or per resource sub-tree level, or something which will 
        allow multiple operations to be performed on different parts of the resource 
        tree at the same time.</p>
      <p><i>Generalized Locking Mechanism</i> - Several Eclipse components and 
        third-party plug-ins have locking mechanisms for serializing concurrent 
        operations that could otherwise corrupt their internal state. Because 
        of the lack of coordination across plug-ins, Eclipse is prone to deadlocks. 
        Eclipse should provide a unified locking story, perhaps based on a mechanism 
        for centrally registering and managing locks, so that plug-ins can coordinate 
        their activities without risking deadlock.</p>
