      July 14, 2003 - Several clients are now using the job manager for background 
      activity, including the UI decorator and various debug threads.  The CVS/Team
      component is using jobs in a "work in progress" mode that has to be enabled
      from preference pages.  This includes background filling of the repository view,
      background update of live sync view, and background CVS operations such as checkout.
      The UI progress indicator needs to be manually enabled by hard-coding the preference
      "showProgressIndicator=true" in the org.eclipse.ui.workbench preference store.
      In branch "Bug_36957", org.eclipse.core.resources now uses background jobs for
      building, resource change notification, and workspace snapshot (incremental save).
      Search and JDT core components are actively working on moving to job manager API.
      <p>
      June 24, 2003 - The additional support from the Workbench team for the responsive UI work 
		has been released to HEAD. It appears in Nightly builds starting with N20030624 and will be 
		included in the July 1 integration build.  Many bug fixes and API refinements have been
		released to the job manager infrastructure in org.eclipse.core.runtime in HEAD.</p>
      <p>
      June 4, 2003 - Implementation of core job manager API has been released to the 3.0 HEAD stream.
      This API is still experimental, and is not currently used by any components in the
      platform.  There is ongoing work in branch "Bug_36957" in both core and UI
      that is beginning to use this API.</p>
