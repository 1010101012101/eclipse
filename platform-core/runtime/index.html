<p>Eclipse currently uses a home-grown runtime model. That is, the runtime model/mechanism 
  was designed and implemented specifically for Eclipse. This is good in that 
  it has been highly optimized and tailored. It is less than optimal in that there 
  are many issues which are complicated and having a unique runtime mechanism 
  does not allow us to reuse the work done in other areas (e.g., OSGi, Avalon, 
  JMX, ...). In particular we are looking for a runtime that has a strong specification, 
  a good component model, supports dynamic behaviour, and is reasonably similar 
  to that of Eclipse.</p>
<p>This last point bears some discussion. While we would like to start with a 
  clean slate and adopt/design a runtime which satisfies everyone's wish list, 
  pragmatically, it must still be possible to run old plug-ins on the new runtime 
  with confidence. That is, the new runtime cannot be so completely different 
  so as to make this difficult/totally inefficient/impossible.</p>
<p>Our attention has focussed on <a href="http://www.osgi.org">OSGi</a> and we 
  have implemented a plug-compatible runtime for Eclipse based on the OSGi specification. 
  Consult the resources below for more information.</p>
