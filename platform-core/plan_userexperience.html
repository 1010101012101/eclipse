      <p><i>Default Location of Workspace</i> - (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=33976">33976</a>, 
        <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=34532">34532</a>) 
        Currently if the user doesn't specify the location of their workspace, 
        then the default is to place is in a &quot;workspace&quot; directory under 
        the Eclipse install directory. (equivalent of using &quot;user.dir&quot; 
        java System property) This is very problematic, especially in the cases 
        where you have a multi-user system and a single shared installation (like 
        Linux) where users don't have write access to the installation directory. 
        A better solution would be to use the user's home directory (&quot;user.home&quot; 
        java System property) as a default location. This would result in (for 
        instance) <i>/usr/home/fred</i> (on Linux) or <i>C:/Documents and Settings/Fred/My 
        Documents</i> (on Windows).</p>
      <p><i><a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-vcm-home/docs/online/team3.0/settings.html">Separation 
        of User Settings and Plug-in Metadata</a></i> - (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36965">36965</a>) 
        It is common for users to want to share some settings (like background 
        colours and fonts) with all workspaces that they use with a particular 
        Eclipse install, while other settings (like compiler settings) should 
        be on a per workspace basis. Currently Eclipse all of these settings on 
        a per workspace basis and we would like to remove this bundling.</p>
      <p><i>Multiple Workspaces</i> - (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37681">37681</a>, 
        <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=5509">5509</a>) 
        Users want to be able to better manage multiple workspace within the Eclipse 
        environment. This could either mean coming up with a way to pretty a single 
        Eclipse image running with 2 workspaces loaded, switching between multiple 
        workspaces within the same session (via File -&gt; Open/Close for instance), 
        etc.</p>
      <p><i>Translation of Executable Messages</i> - (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=35135">35135</a>) 
        The messages which are displayed by the Eclipse executable are currently 
        not translated. We need to define an external message story for this code, 
        as well as the code which is in the startup.jar.</p>
      <p><i>Show User Log File Location</i> - (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=33974">33974</a>) 
        When there is an error trying to start Eclipse we produce a dialog to 
        the user telling them to check their log file but we don't print out the 
        exact location of this file. If the user specified the -data command-line 
        argument then the location of the file is easy to calculate. Otherwise, 
        it is done through Java System properties which is much harder to do in 
        C code. <br>
