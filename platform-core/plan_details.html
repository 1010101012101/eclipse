      <p><b>Concurrency/Background Operations</b></p>
      <p><i>Workspace Lock Granularity</i> - Currently the Eclipse resource model 
        locks the entire workspace for the duration of any workspace modifying 
        operations. This approach does not lend itself to concurrent operations. 
        We would like to have a different approach which allows locking to occur 
        on a per resource or per resource sub-tree level, or something which will 
        allow multiple operations to be performed on different parts of the resource 
        tree at the same time.</p>
      <p><i>Generalized Locking Mechanism</i> - Several Eclipse components and 
        third-party plug-ins have locking mechanisms for serializing concurrent 
        operations that could otherwise corrupt their internal state. Because 
        of the lack of coordination across plug-ins, Eclipse is prone to deadlocks. 
        Eclipse should provide a unified locking story, perhaps based on a mechanism 
        for centrally registering and managing locks, so that plug-ins can coordinate 
        their activities without risking deadlock.</p>

      <p><i>Plug-in Deactivation </i> - (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36956">36956</a>) 
        In Eclipse plug-ins are activated once referenced and they remain in that 
        state for the duration of the user's Eclipse session. In an effort to 
        reduce memory footprint (amung other reasons) we are investigating allowing 
        plug-ins to become deactivated when they are not being used, and thus 
        that amount of memory could be reclaimed for use by the system.</p>
      <p><i>Incremental Registry Resolution</i> - When a user installs new plug-ins 
        in Eclipse, they are currently forced to restart their system in order 
        for their changes to take effect. This is because currently the plug-in 
        registry is parsed when the system starts up and from that point forward 
        it remains static. We would like to change the plug-in registry resolution 
        to be dynamic, that is to allow the user to add new plug-ins to the system 
        and remove plug-ins from the system at any given point in time and have 
        the system react and behave appropriately.</p>

      <p><b>Improve User Experience</b></p>
      <p><i>Default Location of Workspace</i> - (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=33976">33976</a>, 
        <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=34532">34532</a>) 
        Currently if the user doesn't specify the location of their workspace, 
        then the default is to place is in a &quot;workspace&quot; directory under 
        the Eclipse install directory. (equivalent of using &quot;user.dir&quot; 
        java System property) This is very problematic, especially in the cases 
        where you have a multi-user system and a single shared installation (like 
        Linux) where users don't have write access to the installation directory. 
        A better solution would be to use the user's home directory (&quot;user.home&quot; 
        java System property) as a default location. This would result in (for 
        instance) <i>/usr/home/fred</i> (on Linux) or <i>C:/Documents and Settings/Fred/My 
        Documents</i> (on Windows).</p>
      <p><i>Separation of User Settings and Plug-in Metadata</i> - (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36965">36965</a>) 
        It is common for users to want to share some settings (like background 
        colours and fonts) with all workspaces that they use with a particular 
        Eclipse install, while other settings (like compiler settings) should 
        be on a per workspace basis. Currently Eclipse all of these settings on 
        a per workspace basis and we would like to remove this bundling.</p>
      <p><i>Multiple Workspaces</i> - (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37681">37681</a>, 
        <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=5509">5509</a>) 
        Users want to be able to better manage multiple workspace within the Eclipse 
        environment. This could either mean coming up with a way to pretty a single 
        Eclipse image running with 2 workspaces loaded, switching between multiple 
        workspaces within the same session (via File -&gt; Open/Close for instance), 
        etc.</p>
      <p><i>Translation of Executable Messages</i> - (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=35135">35135</a>) 
        The messages which are displayed by the Eclipse executable are currently 
        not translated. We need to define an external message story for this code, 
        as well as the code which is in the startup.jar.</p>
