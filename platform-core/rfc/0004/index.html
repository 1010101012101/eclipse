  <p><b>Summary</b> <br>
    When files in the workspace are modified, the character and line positions
    of any markers in those files can become invalid.  A general mechanism is needed
    for updating marker character and line positions.

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
Many markers make use of the standard marker attributes <tt>CHAR_START</tt>,
<tt>CHAR_END</tt>, and <tt>LINE_NUMBER</tt> defined on <tt>org.eclipse.core.resources.IMarker</tt>.
When a file gets modified, these attributes may be invalidated.  Currently, it is mainly UI
components that update marker positions as edits are made.  However, this approach doesn't
work when files are modified at a lower level, such as by the refactoring and JDOM APIs.
<br>Some initial thoughts on how this update mechanism would function:
<ul>
<li>Such a mechanism would require outside information about what types of edits
occurred.  There can be no automatic marker updating after arbitrary resource changes,
because not enough information will be available.  The updates would probably have to
occur on demand, accompanied by information about what edits occurred.
</li>
<li>From Kai-Uwe: "Updating positions seems simple only at the first glance. Having user defined
marker types, it is also part of the marker type definition how the marker 
positions are updated. Assume a marker at [100, 150. Now assume an insert at 
100. What happens to the marker? Is the marker moved or expanded? Well, you 
can't answer. It depends on the marker type. Even worse, the updating of marker 
positions might depend on the concrete changes, e.g., what was the content of 
the text that has been deleted. The list of these issues can grow rather long. 
Bottom line is that the core can not define the semantics of marker position 
updating but must be open for custom made solutions."
</li>
<li>
The update should be light-weight and as fast as possible.  These updates could
potentially occur after every user edit, or during a large batch of refactoring changes.
</ul>

<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
<h3>Update API</h3>
<p>
Initial proposal is to add a method to IFile.  This is based on the description provided by Jeem:
<pre>
/**
 * Updates the text markers in this file, based on the provided edit information.
 * @param replaceStart The character position at the start of the replaced range. This value
 *		is zero-relative and inclusive.
 * @param replaceEnd The character position at the end of the replaced range.  This value
 *		is zero-relative and exclusive.
 * @param replaceSize The size of the new block that replaced the range described by
 *		replaceStart and replaceEnd.
 * @throws CoreException If this method fails.  Reasons include:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;The given range is invalid.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 */
public void updateMarkers(int replaceStart, int replaceEnd, int replaceSize) throws CoreException;
</pre>
The idea is that this API can describe any single edit to a file.  Examples (again from Jeem):
<ol>
<li>updateMarkers(0, 100, 10) - replace first 100 characters of file with ten characters.</li>
<li>updateMarkers(200, 300, 0) - delete the character range from 200 to 300.</li>
<li>updateMarkers(400,400, 1) - Add a character at position 400.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Extensibility API</h3>
<p>
Some marker types may require a special update algorithm.  The idea is to provide
a way for marker types to define how marker updates occur through the markers
extension point.  The proposal is to add an extra optional element to a marker definition,
to plug in a marker update algorithm.  Here is an example marker definition:
<pre>
&lt;extension 
	id="mycustommarker" 
	point="org.eclipse.core.resources.markers" 
	name="The Foo Marker"&gt;
  &lt;super type="org.eclipse.core.resources.textmarker" /&gt;
  &lt;persistent value="true" /&gt;
  &lt;update class="org.xyz.foo.FooMarkerUpdate"&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>
The update class would implement a new interface, 
<A HREF="IMarkerUpdate.html">IMarkerUpdate</A>.  This interface
has a method similar to the updateMarkers method described above.  Markers
with no update class specified inherit a marker update from one of their marker supertypes.
Supertypes would be searched breadth-first, in the order the supertypes appear in the
marker declaration (or perhaps in an indeterminate order).  Core will provide IMarkerUpdates
for the standard marker types that it defines (marker, text marker, problem, task, bookmark).
</p>
<p>
<b>Open Question:</b> Line number update.  How the LINE_NUMBER attribute will be
updated is an open question.  One possibility is that there would be two separate
methods, one for character updates, and one for line updates.  It is not known if or
how the various marker types make use of the LINE_NUMBER attribute.  Perhaps it
is redundant information and can be recomputed on demand when needed.  A character
update algorithm could theoretically infer the line number changes, but this would require
knowledge of line terminators, etc.  This would also be significantly slower if it required
an independent scan of the file to recompute line numbers during update.
</p>
<h2>RFC Status</h2>
<p>This RFC is currently an initial draft.  The draft will evolve based on feedback
from the various users of IMarker.  Since Core doesn't use markers itself, we are
not in the best position to drive requirements for this feature.  If you are responsible
for code that manipulates markers in text files, please let us know if the proposed
approach will be sufficient for your needs!
