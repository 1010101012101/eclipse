<blockquote><b>Summary</b>
<br>The goal is to provide a basic and extensible way of sharing projects
when a repository is not required.

<h2>
Motivation</h2>
Sometimes when prototyping some features, developers do not want or do
not need to use a repository. But the developer usually wants to have a
way of sharing or persisting the projects that contain these features.
This sharing can be something like sending an email with the project, moving
the project to a new workspace, etc... Moving projects from one workspace to
another using copy/cut and paste could become possible through these APIs.
<br>The current APIs available on Resources plug-in loosely expose ways of
doing a feature similar do the one being proposed. This RFC proposes more 
consistent APIs to allow this kind of sharing. One of the goals is to start
with very few metadata information and add more as more use cases come up.
<h2>
Proposed API</h2>
The current proposal is already in an API format. The API is going to be
added to IWorkspace and consists of:
<p><b>Constants:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="IWorkspace.html#METADATA_ALL">METADATA_ALL</a></li>

<li>
<a href="IWorkspace.html#METADATA_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION">METADATA_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION</a></li>
</ul>
<b>Methods:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="IWorkspace.html#availableProjects(org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPath, org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor)">availableProjects</a></li>

<li>
<a href="IWorkspace.html#exportProjects(org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPath, boolean, org.eclipse.core.resources.IProject[], int, org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor)">exportProjects</a></li>

<li>
<a href="IWorkspace.html#importProjects(org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPath, org.eclipse.core.resources.IProject[], int, org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPath, boolean, org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor)">importProjects</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>
