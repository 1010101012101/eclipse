<blockquote><b>Summary</b>
<br>The goal is to provide a basic and extensible way of sharing projects
across workspaces. In this context, sharing does not mean to have the same
physical files used by different workspaces. But some way of transporting/copying
projects through workspaces.

<h2>
Motivation</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes when prototyping features, developers do not
want or do not need to use a repository. But the developer usually wants
to have a way of sharing these projects with other people. This sharing
can be something like sending an email with the project or moving the project
to a new workspace.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current available APIs on the Resources plug-in
loosely expose ways of implementing a similar feature. This RFC proposes
more consistent APIs to allow this kind of sharing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the goals is start sharing with very few
metadata information and add more as more use cases come up. Although it
would be nice if we could anticipate possible problems with different kind
of metadata.
<h2>
Proposed Solutions:</h2>
<b>Solution #1 - Share projects through a project export file</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consists of storing one or more projects in a file
containing the project's resources and metadata information specified by
the user. The file is written when an export operation is requested and
read with an import operation. The proposed solution is in API format and
would be added to IWorkspace.

<b>Comments about this approach (<img SRC="../images/ok.gif" height=15 width=14>
- favour&nbsp;<img SRC="../images/fail.gif" height=15 width=14> against):</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="../images/fail.gif" height=15 width=14> <b>1.1</b> - Why should we have
this API if we already have API for accessing metadata? Isn't it just a
convenience API?
<blockquote><b>1.1.1</b> <b>( - )</b> For now we do not have any plans
on making all the metadata available through API. For example, things like
the "resource tree" and the various information bits held on "ResourceInfos"
might never become API. The export/import mechanism can be a way for sharing
this metadata through workspaces without committing to undesired API. But,
as you point out, the first implementation of the proposed API could be
done with existing API and we do not know if it is going to evolve to what
I pointed out on the previous sentence. It could end up as only a convenience
API.
<p><b>1.1.2</b> <b>( + )</b> It seems to me that this is the direction
(metadata via a simple api) that would be useful for the cut/copy/paste
case. And as Greg suggests a simple UI change to include/detect this metadata
on export/import means that project export/import could happen with only
minor changes to to the UI.</blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><img SRC="../images/fail.gif" height=15 width=14> <b>1.2</b> - Why should the
UI or even the user be responsible for cleaning up the mess if the operation
fails? As a user I would just go and delete it all and start again. I would
be very nervous about what actually got copied.
<blockquote><b>1.2.1 ( - )</b> Here is an extreme use case: suppose the
export file is corrupted but anything you can recover from that is worth
a try. If core or UI delete things when something goes wrong, the user
does not have a chance to recover these pieces of data.</blockquote>

<ul>
<ul><b>1.2.1.1 ( - )</b> I think the ability to show the user a yes/yes
to all/no/cancel dialog when an overwrite situation occurs is a requirement
(see IOverwriteQuery). We are able to perform this for current import/export
because we are performing them one resource at a time. Without a callback
from core for overwrite during project import we will not be able to make
project import work like file system/zip import.</ul>
</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><img SRC="../images/fail.gif" height=15 width=14> <b>1.3</b> - It seems that I
can set overwrite or force to true but then if a collision happens the
operation just stops and reports that error potentially leaving things
half done. This would require the UI cleanup (although core should do that),
and then if the user says "yes go ahead" the UI would have to start it
all from the begging with force/overwrite being true. Typically when an
overrwite happens there is a yes, yes all type confirmation given however
there does not appear to be sufficient support to provide this?
<blockquote><b>1.3.1</b> <b>( - )</b> True, there is no support for that
as there is no support for it on similar APIs like IResource.move and IResource.copy.
It seems consistent through the resources API but there's room for discussion.</blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><img SRC="../images/fail.gif" BORDER=0 height=15 width=14> <b>1.4</b> - In summary
it is unclear to me why core would want to get into creating a projectExportFile.
It seems to be just a zip that includes some metadata. Why doesn't core
simply add api to produce/read this metadata description? A file with this
metadata could be added to the project/read from the project, on export/import
with only minor modifications to existing File System and Zip wizards.
<ul><b>1.4.1 ( + )</b> Randy's suggestion is an interesting variant on
my observation. I was observing that if the meta data was just always stored
as a file then no special facility/api is needed. Randy's interesting variant
says if we really have to store it not as a file, then all we need is the
ability to drop it into a file on export, and to create a project using
the file (which we could call on import).
<p><b>1.4.2 ( - )</b> It seems that an approach having a separate file
holding the metadata dropped into the project content area can be brittle.
Seems very easy for this file to get out-of-date. Having a single file
containing resources + metadata sounds more consistent.
<br>&nbsp;
<ul><b>1.4.2.1 ( - )</b> If I understand the purpose, the metadata file
shouldn't appear as part of the project in the workspace after an import.&nbsp;
The only way it could go out of date is if the user unzipped it, modified
some stuff, and rezipped it.
<br>&nbsp;
<ul><b>1.4.2.1.1 ( + )</b> Agreed. It was a misundertanding. It would only
be a problem if the file stayed around after an import. The callers of
this possible API would have to take care of deleting this metadata file.</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><img SRC="../images/fail.gif" BORDER=0 height=15 width=14> <b>1.5</b> - I'll confess
to not being sold on the one big file.&nbsp; It feels like we are inventing
a new format, when we have existing export/import that work. In the past
we've usually had&nbsp; grief when using special files, and we sometimes
find we have to keep adding &amp; adding api as we want to add features.
For example, assume we ever wanted to piecewise load folders from the file,
we would need special api for it. But if it was a standard import/export
format it would be doable without change.&nbsp; If we wanted to show a
user a view showing them the various available exported wads and the detailed
contents of each, we can't do it without additional api (current spec'd
api only gives us available projects).
<blockquote><b>1.5.1 ( - )</b> The proposed API is flexible enough in order
to add more metadata to the export file. About other features, yes, we
would have to add more API.</blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><img SRC="../images/fail.gif" BORDER=0 height=15 width=14> <b>1.6</b> - In the
big-file case I am not sure what the spec'd behavior is if you hit a corruption.
Do you stop immediately or continue just skipping the bad things. If you
stop immediately then it would be limited in what I can recover. Things
after the corruption go unrecoverable. This seems to suggest we would be
safer to avoid a special big-file format. If it was standard export with
meta flattened into it then a user could recover parts as needed.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><img SRC="../images/fail.gif" BORDER=0 height=15 width=14> <b>1.7</b> - It is
not clear to me that this proposal can support cut/copy/paste. Transfers
(the classes which implement the code required for cut/copy/paste) are
stateless. Any information they require must be placed on the clipboard.
This can be real data as in the case of a text transfer or a reference
(ex. filename) as in the case of a file transfer.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performing project copy/paste within a workspace
is easy. We just place a reference (path) for the project on the clipboard
and then lookup the real project (to copy it) when we paste.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to perform a cut/copy/paste across workspaces
we need the metadata required to recreate a project in the second workspace.
We don't need the actual contents of the project since we can just use
a reference to the location of these contents.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The alternative (given the proposed api) is that
cut/copy would create a temporary projectExportFile and place a reference
to it on the clipboard. However this violates the principle of not doing
any real work until paste (if you were just "copying" the project to get
its name to paste it into a text editor then creating the export file is
a real waste) .
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A comparison I would make is that VAJ had the abiltiy
to create a jar or just create a manifest. Core should have api to create
a projectExportFile (data + metadata) or just just the project metadata
(so that it can be placed on the clipboard along with a reference to the
data).
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>Solution #2 - Have the shareable metadata under the project's content
location</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consists of having all the shareable information
available under the project content location (like it already happens with
.vcm_meta and .classpath).
<p><b>Comments about this approach (<img SRC="../images/ok.gif" height=15 width=14>
- favour&nbsp;<img SRC="../images/fail.gif" height=15 width=14> against):</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="../images/ok.gif" height=15 width=14> <b>2.1</b> - The VCM plugin exports/imports
projects, but not into a zip/jar but into a repository. There is one main
undocumented requirement that VCM has imposed on plugins that want do be
VCM import/export compatible: a plugin _must_ save shared configuration
information about a project into the project's file hierarchy and not in
.metadata (e.g. .classpath is managed by JDT). However, the resources plugin
does not play by the same rules. The VCM plugin was made responsible for
persisting the shared configuration information for the resources plugin
(e.g. .vcm_meta).
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><img SRC="../images/ok.gif" BORDER=0 height=15 width=14> <b>2.2</b> - Why should
the resources plugin be special in regards to VCM import/export requirements?
<blockquote><b>2.2.1 ( - )</b> I agree that it should not. But it is easy
to look at the current scenario and say so. Currently, the only resources
information (that I know) VCM is sharing in the project content area is
the project description. This information can be easily represented in
one file and changes to this file do not need to be merged. Now, thinking
about the future and getting something more complex like markers (or persistent
properties). As an implementation detail, they are currently persisted
as one unique file. If we keep this format, this file would need to be
merged if it gets out of sync with the repository. To do so, more APIs
will have to be added in order to VCM inspect it and figure out what has
changed and ask the user what should be done (as it currently does with
text files). I'm not saying it is impossible, only that it is a kind of
change that will likely be hard to happen.</blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><img SRC="../images/ok.gif" BORDER=0 height=15 width=14> <b>2.3</b> - The resources
plugin is not the only plugin interested in importing and exporting projects.
Eclipse just don't have a consistent story for how plugins can identify
shareable configuration information. The suggested API is, in my opinion,
another way of avoiding the issue of how to handle the problem in a more
general way. So how can the general import/export mechanism support both
VCM's and a zip/jar tool needs?
