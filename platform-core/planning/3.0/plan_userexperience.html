        Currently if the user doesn't specify the location of their workspace, 
        then the default is to place is in a &quot;workspace&quot; directory under 
        the Eclipse install directory. (equivalent of using &quot;user.dir&quot; 
        java System property) This is very problematic, especially in the cases 
        where you have a multi-user system and a single shared installation (like 
        Linux) where users don't have write access to the installation directory. 
        A better solution would be to use the user's home directory (&quot;user.home&quot; 
        java System property) as a default location. This would result in (for 
        instance) <i>/usr/home/fred</i> (on Linux) or <i>C:/Documents and Settings/Fred</i> 
        (on Windows).</p>

        It is common for users to want to share some settings (like background 
        colours and fonts) with all workspaces that they use with a particular 
        Eclipse install, while other settings (like compiler settings) should 
        be on a per workspace basis. Currently Eclipse all of these settings on 
        a per workspace basis and we would like to remove this bundling.</p>

        Users want to be able to better manage multiple workspace within the Eclipse 
        environment. This could either mean coming up with a way to pretty a single 
        Eclipse image running with 2 workspaces loaded, switching between multiple 
        workspaces within the same session (via File -&gt; Open/Close for instance), 
        etc. <i>Need to re-visit this for M5. Potential for some of this work

        The messages which are displayed by the Eclipse executable are currently

        as well as the code which is in the startup.jar.</p>

        When there is an error trying to start Eclipse we produce a dialog to 
        the user telling them to check their log file but we don't print out the 
        exact location of this file. If the user specified the -data command-line 
        argument then the location of the file is easy to calculate. Otherwise, 
        it is done through Java System properties which is much harder to do in 
        C code. </p>

      <p><em>Improve Workspace/File-system Synchronization</em> - (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36962">36962</a>) 
        Improve workspace synchronization with file system. A file resource in 
        the workspace gets out of sync when the underlying file in the file system 
        is created, deleted, or rewritten outside of Eclipse. File resources usually 
        remains out of sync until the user explicitly hits Refresh. The Eclipse 
        Platform should provide ways to keep the in-memory representation in sync 
        with the file system; for example, by hooking OS file system callbacks 
        where available, and by polling for file system changes in a background 
        thread. </p>
 
	  <em>Notes:</em> We need to improve the case where people are editing files 
      outside of Eclipse and we detect that the files in the user's workspace 
      are out of sync with the file system. A good general statement is &quot;it 
      is hard to use Eclipse when the files are not in sync&quot;. Currently there 
      exists the auto-refresh plug-in which users can download and install. We 
      need to look at integrating this into the SDK. There are legal issues for 
      this as well as technical issues. First step might be to do a package rename 
      and start to include it in the build, with future work including integrating 
      it better into the base plug-ins. </p>

	  <td><p><em>Editing files outside of the workspace </em>- (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37935">37935</a>) 
        Allow editors to open files outside workspace. A common request is to 
        be able to use Eclipse to open a file that is not part of the workspace, 
        or perhaps even one on a remote system. In addition, applications would 
        like to provide file extension associations so that double-clicking on 
        a file in the OS desktop would open the associated Eclipse editor. The 
        operations and capabilities available on these "outside of the workspace" 
        files would need to be defined. </p> </p>
      <p><em>Notes: </em>Users would like to be able to (for instance) double-click 
        on a java file in Windows Explorer and open up Eclipse with that file 
        so they can use the JDT/UI Java Editor. What people want: associate files, 
        syntax-hightlighting and content assist. We could have a known project 
        (e.g. &quot;External Files&quot;) then you would be able to set up a classpath 
        and project references for that project so you could get content assist, 
        etc.<br>
