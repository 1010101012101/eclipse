      <p><b>Current status</b></p>
      <p><em>July 12, 2004</em></p>	  
	  <p>3.0 was released on June 26. The encoding story was changed since 3.0 
        M8 to allow setting the encoding for an individual resource. In the end 
        of the 3.0 cycle, a highly demanded feature was that resource change events 
        were issued when the encoding for files changed (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=59899">59899</a>, 
        planned for 3.0.1). There is <a href="../../documents/plan_encoding_events.html">ongoing 
        work</a> on investigating how such feature can be provided. </p>
      <p><em>February 23, 2004</em></p>
      <p>A new version for the proposal has been released. Major changes include 
        the removal of support for setting the encoding for a specific file, folder-level 
        default encodings and encoding-change events. Part of the API proposed has 
        been released as part of the 3.0 M7 milestone build. There is ongoing work 
        on support from Runtime to determine the encoding for arbitrary input streams.</p>
      <p><em>June 10, 2003</em></p>	  
      <p><a href="../../documents/old_plan_encoding_intro.html">Original</a> proposal was made available. </p>
      <p>Gathering feedback from the community.</p>
