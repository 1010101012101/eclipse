      <ul>
        <li><strong>Running from JARs</strong> <em>[dj + pascal + jeff]</em> 
          <ul>
            <li>[<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=85065">bug 
              85065</a>] We are working towards being able to run an Eclipse with 
              each plug-in being in a single JAR file rather than a directory 
              containing multiple files and JARs. We are currently identifying 
              the list of issues which are preventing us from running and self-hosting 
              with this setup. Some of the items remaining to address are: 
              <ul>
                <li> source association between the JARs and the source plug-ins</li>
                <li> debugging, setting breakpoints and stepping into JAR'd plug-ins</li>
                <li> dealing with plug-ins who define ant tasks</li>
                <li> building JAR'd Eclipses (PDE/Build)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Note that running from JARs works correctly, most of the remaining 
              issues are related to normal everyday development with a JAR'd Eclipse 
              as your Target Platform.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Shipping manifest files</strong> 
          <ul>
            <li> If a plug-in defines a legacy plug-in manifest rather than a 
              bundle manifest, then on start-up we take a hit because we have 
              to run through all the plug-in manifests and generate the corresponding 
              bundle manifest file.</li>
            <li>For 3.1, we would like to ship bundle manifest files for all plug-ins 
              in the SDK.</li>
            <li>Mostly this is an education item: educate the other teams and 
              help them do what they need to do.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Performance Dynamic Team</strong> <em>[john]</em> 
          <ul>
            <li> Instrumentation is now in the Core.</li>
            <li> Have ui views which (when running in dev mode) let people know 
              if certain operations are taking too long.</li>
            <li> Investigation of using aspects.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>NLS and message bundles</strong> <em>[john + dj]</em>

              story</a> is now defined and base code is released to Core.</li>
            <li>We need to educate other teams on what to do. (how to convert, 
              how to maintain)</li>
            <li>JDT/UI is working on hooking tooling into current NLS tooling 
              story.</li>

        </li>
        <li> <strong>Classloading</strong> <em>[pascal + jeff] </em> 
          <ul>
            <li> There are situations arising where other teams (RMI, Hibernate, 
              etc) are having classloader problems. We need to investigate what 
              we can do to help them out. </li>
            <li> Level of help can be anything from hooks in code to coding patterns 
              or something else.</li>

            <li>We want to make a concerted effort to have more discussions on 
              the platform-core mailing list. </li>
            <li>This will make other teams aware of the on-goings of the Core 
              team. (since we don't have fancy UI features to appear in the New 
              &amp; Noteworthy for each milestone :-)</li>

			</ul>
		<li><b>Registry Structure</b> (Pascal)</li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Summary:</em> Another representation of the registry has been written and it has a few
				performance improvements in both the time and space aspects.</li>
				<li><em>Milestone 4:</em> Mcq and Pascal will do a code review Nov 9 and we will evaluate the forward 
				direction at following team meeting. This code needs to be released in first 2 weeks 
				of M4 or we need to decide that the benefit is not good enough and we will move on.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Large Scale Workspaces</b> (John)</li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Summary:</em> We have been investigating things which will help make life easier for developers 
				who are working with large workspaces. (e.g. in excess of 75,000 resources)</li>
				<li><em>Milestone 4:</em></li>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="../../documents/3.1/large_scale_issues.html">Overview</a> of issues collected from community</li>
						<li>New code for <a href="../../documents/3.1/background_refresh.html">background populating new projects<a/> created in existing locations will
						be released first week of M4. We need to determine if this code has an effect on 
						ClearCase users. (should be positive effect)</li>
						<li>Investigate issues with CDT and builders - not all builders are incremental 
						which means builds aren't trival. (e.g. bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=74200">74200</a>)</li>
						<li>Scalability (e.g. review slots on ResourceInfo class)</li>
						<li>Deletion performance</li>
							<ul>
								<li>There is no recursive delete function in java.</li>
								<li>investigate writing a native (Mcq?)</li>
								<li>Note: how will this effect our best-effort delete strategy?</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				<li><em>Ongoing:</em></li>

				<li><em>Summary:</em> </li>
				<li><em>Milestone 4:</em> Investigation into dynamic plugin support and object tracking.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>IndexedStore work</b> (Rafael)</li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Summary:</em> We are looking at replacing the underlying mechanism of the history and property stores. We have used
				a B-tree implementation but we believe the implemention is more complex than we need. The stores are
				separated into 2 parts: the index store and the blob store. The index store maps paths to UUIDs the
				the blob store maps UUIDs to blobs. It is the index store part of the mechanism which we are looking
				at replacing. We have an initial implementation which tries to use the file system to help with the
				mapping.</li>
				<li><em>Milestone 4:</em> Performance work. Migration/Backwards compatibility story. (potentially a lot of work here)
				Investigate garbage collection in background operation.
				Investigate snapshots (time permitting) (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36958">bug 36958</a>)</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>PDE/Build</b> (Pascal)</li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Summary:</em> The original purpose for PDE/Build was to be able to build Eclipse from Ant tasks but lately there have 
				been bug reports about PDE/Build not being workspace-aware. (e.g. linked resources, classpath,
				compiler options) This would require a lot of work (essentially a complete re-write) so before do anything
				we need to construct a list of problems that we are seeing and come up with a risk vs benefit
				analysis. Also we should investigate if there is a subset of issues we can fix with minimal work.</li>
				<li><em>Milestone 4:</em> Identify list of problems. Identify issue subset.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Resource Bundles</b></li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Summary:</em> The size of resource bundles and bundle keys has always been a concern and performance issue. We need
				to investigate strategies for making improvements in this area. We need to talk to other teams (JDT/UI?)
				about the tooling. Also this is of importance to the performance team, perhaps we can get help/ideas from them?</li>
				<li><em>Milestone 4:</em> TBD (talk to Erich to see where this is on his radar)</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Managing Bugzilla</b> (all)</li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Summary:</em> Our bug counts are ever-growing so we are going to make an effort to reduce the number of
				open bugs in our components. We need to be agressive with reports. There are a couple of categories which make up a lot
				of bugs: enhancements which we don't plan on implementing and bug reports which we can't reproduce.
				If we don't plan on implementing a feature, then we should close the bug and use the "helpwanted"
				keyword. If we can't replicate a bug and its been open for longer than 6 months, we should close it.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Test Suites</b> (all)</li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Summary:</em> We have a lot of performance tests in the Resources project which should
				be converted over to use the new framework.</li>
				<li><em>Milestone 4:</em> Convert existing performance tests to use new framework.</li>
