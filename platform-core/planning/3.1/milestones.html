            <li>Performance is THE top item which is going to be addressed for 
              M7 by the Eclipse team as a whole. Tod and John have already been 
              working together and identifying some performance problems and during 
              this milestone more people are going to be added to the team.</li>
            <li>Look at the posts about String#substring from the eclipse mailing 
              lists and ensure that we are doing the right thing.</li>

          <ul>

            <li>Should create some performance tests for OSGi class loading.</li>
            <li>Test Eclipse start-up on a non-empty workspace.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>All plug-ins included in the RCP SDK are being shipped as JARs 
              (in all dev drops...Platform, JDT, etc) for M6.</li>
            <li>Will convert more plug-ins for M7.</li>
            <li>Need to get more performance numbers. Will fully JAR up the M6 
              build and run the performance tests on the performance machine to 
              compare against the M6 regular drop.</li>

            <li> If a plug-in defines a legacy plug-in manifest rather than a 
              bundle manifest, then on start-up we take a hit because we have 
              to run through all the plug-in manifests and generate the corresponding 
              bundle manifest file.</li>
            <li> For 3.1, we would like to ship bundle manifest files for all 
              plug-ins in the SDK.</li>
            <li> Mostly this is an education item: educate the other teams and

				<li>On plug-in export, the scripts are being executed in the workspace VM and we would like to move this to be in a separate VM. We will work with
				the Ant team to make this happen. Also need involvment from PDE/UI team.</li>
				<li>PDE/UI has a model of the target platform and currently PDE/Build makes their own model. We want to
				investigate sharing of these models.</li>
				<li>Cross platform export of RCP product - e.g. we would like to be able to export a Linux drop from a Windows machine.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><strong>Extension Registry</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Investigate performance of non lazy loading of the registry. (e.g. when the registry is always in memory) This might be useful for small applications.</li>
				<li>Investigate performance of the registry when it is located on a network drive.</li>
				<li>Compare performance numbers of having the registry always in memory versus having parts flushed out to disk, Explore the idea 
				of switching lazy on or off depending on the number of plug-ins.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><strong>OSGi</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Investigate performance of the OSGi state when it is located on a network drive.</li>
				<li>Investigate automatic closure of JAR files based on time-outs, etc.</li>
				<li>Investigate buddy class-loading.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><strong>Documentation</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Write a document describing how to setup eclipse install (in shared install, non local dirive, etc).</li>

              86236</a>] The way executable extensions are created is limited (instantiate

              demonstrated that this limitation needed to be alleviated. We need to come

              85065</a>] We are working towards being able to run an Eclipse with 
              each plug-in being in a single JAR file rather than a directory 
              containing multiple files and JARs. We are currently identifying 
              the list of issues which are preventing us from running and self-hosting 
              with this setup. Some of the items remaining to address are: 
              <ul>
                <li> source association between the JARs and the source plug-ins</li>
                <li> debugging, setting breakpoints and stepping into JAR'd plug-ins</li>

				<li><em>Milestone 4:</em> Mcq and Pascal will do a code review Nov 9 and we will evaluate the forward 
				direction at following team meeting. This code needs to be released in first 2 weeks

		<li><b>Large Scale Workspaces</b> (John)</li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Summary:</em> We have been investigating things which will help make life easier for developers

						be released first week of M4. We need to determine if this code has an effect on 
						ClearCase users. (should be positive effect)</li>
						<li>Investigate issues with CDT and builders - not all builders are incremental 
						which means builds aren't trival. (e.g. bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=74200">74200</a>)</li>

				<li><em>Milestone 4:</em> Investigation into dynamic plugin support and object tracking.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>IndexedStore work</b> (Rafael)</li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Summary:</em> We are looking at replacing the underlying mechanism of the history and property stores. We have used
				a B-tree implementation but we believe the implemention is more complex than we need. The stores are
				separated into 2 parts: the index store and the blob store. The index store maps paths to UUIDs the
				the blob store maps UUIDs to blobs. It is the index store part of the mechanism which we are looking
				at replacing. We have an initial implementation which tries to use the file system to help with the
				mapping.</li>
				<li><em>Milestone 4:</em> Performance work. Migration/Backwards compatibility story. (potentially a lot of work here)
				Investigate garbage collection in background operation.
				Investigate snapshots (time permitting) (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36958">bug 36958</a>)</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>PDE/Build</b> (Pascal)</li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Summary:</em> The original purpose for PDE/Build was to be able to build Eclipse from Ant tasks but lately there have 
				been bug reports about PDE/Build not being workspace-aware. (e.g. linked resources, classpath,
				compiler options) This would require a lot of work (essentially a complete re-write) so before do anything
				we need to construct a list of problems that we are seeing and come up with a risk vs benefit
				analysis. Also we should investigate if there is a subset of issues we can fix with minimal work.</li>
				<li><em>Milestone 4:</em> Identify list of problems. Identify issue subset.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Resource Bundles</b></li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Summary:</em> The size of resource bundles and bundle keys has always been a concern and performance issue. We need
				to investigate strategies for making improvements in this area. We need to talk to other teams (JDT/UI?)
				about the tooling. Also this is of importance to the performance team, perhaps we can get help/ideas from them?</li>
				<li><em>Milestone 4:</em> TBD (talk to Erich to see where this is on his radar)</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Managing Bugzilla</b> (all)</li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Summary:</em> Our bug counts are ever-growing so we are going to make an effort to reduce the number of
				open bugs in our components. We need to be agressive with reports. There are a couple of categories which make up a lot
				of bugs: enhancements which we don't plan on implementing and bug reports which we can't reproduce.
				If we don't plan on implementing a feature, then we should close the bug and use the "helpwanted"
				keyword. If we can't replicate a bug and its been open for longer than 6 months, we should close it.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Test Suites</b> (all)</li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Summary:</em> We have a lot of performance tests in the Resources project which should
				be converted over to use the new framework.</li>
