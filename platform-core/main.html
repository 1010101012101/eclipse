      <p>The Core component forms the base of the Eclipse platform's runtime configuration. 
        It includes mechanisms and facilities for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>booting and running the platform</li>
        <li>plug-in declaration and management</li>
        <li>resource management</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Core is excruciatingly generic -- all plug-ins installed and run 
        on the Core infrastructure are treated equally. The contents of resources 
        are never examined in any domain-specific way and the Core can run equally 
        well with and without a UI. </p>

      <p>Now that the 2.0 release and the 2.0.1 patch have been delivered, we are focusing on the 
	  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_2_1.html">Eclipse 2.1</a> deliverable.
	  Specifically, here are some of our goals for the next little while:</p>
	  
	  <p><a name="Milestone_Planning"></a><em>Milestone 1 (2.1 M1)</em> - September 20, 2002</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The rigid structure of projects in Eclipse is a problem with a lot of users' existing project layouts. 
		See <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=6664">bug 6664</a> for more information.
		For this milestone we would like to have a proposal ready and posted to this web space for comment by the open source community.
		Once posted, comments should be sent to the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/platform-core-dev">platform-core-dev@eclipse.org</a> 
		mailing list. <i>Note: this item has been pushed back to M2 with the creation of a new team to address the problem. See below for details.</i>
		</li>
		<li>Work towards building tools which will help with crash recovery and 
          analysis of metadata files on disk.</li>
        <li>General bug fixing.</li>
      </ul>
	  
	  <p><em>Milestone 2 (2.1 M2)</em> - October 18, 2002</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Progress on the project structure problem has been made. A dynamic team has been formed and a "Problem Definition" document
	  has been <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/inflexible-projects-problem.html">posted</a> to eclipse.org. 
	  The goal for M2 is to have the proposal (including solution) finalized and posted.</li>
	  <li>Continued work on tools and examples. Check the <a href="dev.html">Development 
       Resources</a> for progress...tools plug-ins will be posted there.</li>
	  <li>General bug fixing and triage work on backlog of bugs in the Inbox.</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p><em>Milestone 3 (2.1 M3)</em> - November 15, 2002</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Project Structure - You've seen the links to the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/inflexible-projects-problem.html">problem 
          definition</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/towards-more-flexible-projects.html">possible 
          solutions</a>. A third document with the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/flexible-projects-proposal.html">proposed 
          solution</a> is now posted. The specific Platform/Core required work for M3 includes:
		  <ul>
            <li>new API for creating links to files and folders 
            <li>javadoc changes to existing API (copy/move/delete) 
            <li>ammended Natures doc - adding new attribute for veto-power 
            <li>new API for workspace path variables to be used with linked resources
            <li>new Team hook for link veto-power
            <li>new API for mapping from a file-system location to workspace resource(s), 
              and vice versa
          </ul>		  
        <li>Circular Build Dependancies - A dynamic team to address this problem has been created. The work required for the
	  Platform/Core team for the M3 milestone consists of new API for computing the default project build order and a new
	  algorithm for calculating the build order when there are cycles involved. (related bugs: 
	  <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25952">25952</a>,
	  <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=10262">10262</a>) 
	  <li>Features - A dynamic team consisting of Dean, Jeff, Dejan, Christophe, and DJ has been created to address all the problems
	  that the Release Engineering team has with features. Once an appropriate solution has been identified, there will be 
	  significant work in the PDE-Build component (which is owned by Platform/Core) for both the M3 and M4 milestones.
	  <li>General Bug Fixing.
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p><em>Milestone 4 (2.1 M4)</em> - December 13, 2002</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Project Structures - Finish up work related to flexible project layout. List includes multi-resource delta notification
	  for over-lapping linked resources. (related bugs: <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25993">25993</a>)
	  <li>Classloader Performance - In M2 we put in a classloader performance enhancement in which the plug-in classloader
	  used information in a file to determine whether or not it should look in itself for a particular class. We want to allow
	  users to put this information in the mark-up in their plugin.xml files. (related bugs: <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=24667">24667</a>
	  , <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26011">26011</a>)
	  <li>Continued progress on PDE-Build in the space related to the Features dynamic team.
	  <li>New feature to allow local history to persist across certain refactoring actions. (related bug: 
	  <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=24787">24787</a>)
	  <li>General Bug Fixing

      <p>If you are interested in participating in the development of the Core 
        component, check out the developer's mailing list: <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/platform-core-dev">platform-core-dev@eclipse.org</a>. 
        Chat with people there about your problems and interests, and find out 
        what you can do to help. </p>
      <p>In particular, if you are interested in system level code and are intimately 
        familiar with Java classloading, thread management, filesystem resource 
        management on a variety of operating systems, Windows/Linux filesystem 
        callback management, or programming for speed/space, the Core team wants 
        to talk to you.</p>
      <p>Upcoming work is primarily in the details of currently supported function.</p>
