<p><u>Summary:</u> In the old code, clients registered property change listeners 
  so they would be notified when changes occurred to their preference value. Now 
  this becomes more complicated since we have multiple places (scopes) where the 
  preference values can be stored.</p>
<p>Right now clients must register preference change listeners on a per-node basis 
  where the preferences are stored in a tree and each first-level child of the 
  root is a sub-tree specific to a different preference scope. But at the client 
  level, they are more likely to be interested in all changes to a particular 
  preference, not just changes in a specific scope. If this is the case, clients 
  don’t want to be concerned with adding a change listener to every node that 
  holds onto that preference. (See <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=54392">bug 
  54392</a>) </p><p>&nbsp;</p>

    	<td WIDTH="98%"><b>References to removed preference nodes</b> 
<p><u>Summary:</u> Preference nodes are not handles (like with <code>java.io.File</code>) 
  and therefore the nodes can be removed while a client has a reference to one. 
  If API is called on a removed preference node, then an <code>IllegalStateException</code> 
  will be thrown. We need to consider what we can do to help clients. Perhaps 
  making a handle-like interface is best? (See <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=54907">bug 
  54907</a>)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

    	<td WIDTH="98%"><b>Batched Event Processing</b> 
<p><u>Summary:</u> In the case where there are a lot of preference change events happening in sucession, clients
are interested in receiving batch notification of these events. Fixing this will be tricky since we will have to 
add new API to handle the batch requests but we don't want to break people who currently are expecting a single
event at a time. (See <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77144">bug 77144</a>)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

    	<td WIDTH="98%"><b>Metadata associated with preferences</b> 
<p><u>Summary:</u> There are certain types of information that needs to be associated with preferences. Some examples of information are:
<ul>
<li>The user-interface needs to know a human-readable name to display to the user.</li>
<li>The preference could be marked as read-only.</li>
<li>The preference could be non-exportable.</li>
<li>Preference groupings and dependencies.</li>
</ul>

In essence, preferences need to have metadata associated with them.  The problem is that Preferences are key/value pairs 
on node objects and not real objects themselves. This means that we cannot store metadata directly with the preferences. What
we need is a way to store an association between preference keys and a group of metadata. Perhaps if the metadata itself was keyed 
and we used the full path of the node+key, we could use this (path -> metadata object) reference as a base for 
searching/storage of this information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

    	<td WIDTH="98%"><b>Change notification in the background</b> 
		<p><u>Summary:</u> We would like to move preference change notification 
        to the background to help prevent against bad client code. We have to 
        be careful though because there are existing clients who have change listeners 
        who are expecting the notifications to happen in the UI thread. In these 
        cases they are making UI changes and will get an Invalid Thread Access 
        error. (See <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77280">bug 
        77280</a>)</p>
      <p><u>Update:</u> Here is a <a href="background_notification.html">document</a> 
        describing the issues in more detail.</p>

		proved to be confusing to users.
