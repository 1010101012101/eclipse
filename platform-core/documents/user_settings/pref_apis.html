<h1><center><u>Preference APIs in Eclipse</u></center></h1>
<h2>Potential Preference API Problems in 3.1</h2>
<h3>1). Property change events (typing)</h3>
<p><u>Summary:</u> Property change events occur when a new property key/value 
  pair is added to the preference store, when a value is changed, or when a key 
  is removed. The old and new values for the key/value pair are included in the 
  property change event objects that are broadcast to all registered listeners.</p>
<p>The lowest Core level preference APIs specify the types of the value in the 
  event object to be either a String representation of the value or null. The 
  upper Core level APIs and the JFace APIs specify the types to be real types. 
  (e.g. <code>Integer</code> for <code>int</code>, <code>Boolean</code> for <code>boolean</code>, 
  etc)</p>
<p>There is also a problem with the upper Core and JFace preferences that has 
  always existed but has surfaced recently with the move to the new implementation 
  underneath. Since the preferences are store un-typed on the file system, there 
  are certain cases where we don’t know the type of the preference value when 
  replacing it or removing it from the store. One example occurs when you import 
  new preference values.</p>
<p><u>Solution:</u> We discussed the problem with Jeem and came to the conclusion 
  that the old specs should be updated to say that the values in the property 
  change events will be typed if possible, but also may be String values. Proper 
  clients should be able to react to both situations.</p>
<p><u>Status:</u> Done.</p>
<h3>2). No notification during <code>#putValue()</code></h3>
<p><u>Summary:</u> The JFace APIs have a new method called <code>IPreferenceStore#putValue()</code> 
  which stores the value of the preference in the preference store but does not 
  notify any listeners. This method is intended for use by client decorators and 
  in other applications where setting preference values are required to be more 
  performent.</p>
<p>One of the client use cases for preference change listeners is to cache 
  the preference values locally and then update the cache when someone changes 
  the values via the regular API and a change event is received. The problem occurs
  when another client calls the <code>#putValue()</code> API and the cache's listener
  is not notified and the cache will become out of sync. 
</p>
<p>A concrete example of this occurs with the <code>org.eclipse.core.resources</code> 
plug-in and the workspace description. For performance reasons, it was decided to cache
the preference value of whether or not the workspace is in auto-build mode. A preference
change listener is registered and when any client changes this value, the cache is updated.
If clients change this value via <code>#putValue()</code> then the Resources plug-in's
listener will not be notified and the value for <code>IWorkspaceDescription#isAutoBuilding()</code> will be out of date.
</p>
  
<p><u>Solution:</u> The spec for <code>IPreferenceStore#putValue()</code> should be 
updated to say that clients should only be calling this method on their own private 
preference keys and should not be modifying any preference keys which are public API.</p>
<p><u>Status:</u> To Be Done.</p>
<h3>3). RCP plug-ins and no instance location</h3>
<p><u>Summary:</u> Plug-ins which are part of the RCP should be able to handle the case 
  where we are running with no instance location. This includes accessing their preferences via <code>Plugin#getPluginPreferences()</code> and <code>AbstractUIPlugin#getPreferenceStore()</code> which accesses the preferences in the instance scope.</p>
  <p>Currently the <code>org.eclipse.ui</code> plug-in accesses its instance preferences
  indirectly by calling <code>#getPreferenceStore().setDefault()</code> in its preference
  initialization code. Other plug-ins did the same thing but have been converted to use
  the new API to access the default preference scope.</p>
<p><u>Solution:</u> Code in the preference initializer which accessed the instance and default
scopes should be changed only to access the default scope and set the default preference values
on that node directly. </p>
<p><u>Status:</u> Done. Bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=76506">76506</a>
was entered to track the last of the issues. It has been verified that all the plug-ins
that are part of the RCP use the new preference APIs and don't access the instance
area before it has been set.</p>
<h2><a name="radar"></a>Issues on the Radar</h2>
<h3>1). Property change listeners across scopes</h3>
<p><u>Summary:</u> In the old code, clients registered property change listeners 
  so they would be notified when changes occurred to their preference value. Now 
  this becomes more complicated since we have multiple places (scopes) where the 
  preference values can be stored.</p>
<p>Right now clients must register preference change listeners on a per-node basis 
  where the preferences are stored in a tree and each first-level child of the 
  root is a sub-tree specific to a different preference scope. But at the client 
  level, they are more likely to be interested in all changes to a particular 
  preference, not just changes in a specific scope. If this is the case, clients 
  don’t want to be concerned with adding a change listener to every node that 
  holds onto that preference. (See <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=54392">bug 
  54392</a>) </p>
<h3>2). References to removed preference nodes</h3>
<p><u>Summary:</u> Preference nodes are not handles (like with <code>java.io.File</code>) 
  and therefore the nodes can be removed while a client has a reference to one. 
  If API is called on a removed preference node, then an <code>IllegalStateException</code> 
  will be thrown. We need to consider what we can do to help clients. Perhaps 
  making a handle-like interface is best? (See <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=54907">bug 
  54907</a>)</p>
