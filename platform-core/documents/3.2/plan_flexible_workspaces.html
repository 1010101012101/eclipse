<h1>Migration to flexible workspaces</h1>
<font size="-1">Last modified: October 11, 2005</font> 
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
In Eclipse 3.1 and earlier, the <tt>org.eclipse.core.resources</tt> plugin was tightly
coupled with the local file system.  Each project and linked resource was mapped 
to a particular file or directory in the local file system.  In Eclipse 3.2, support
was added to create resources that are stored in an arbitrary file system.
For example, a project can now be created whose files and directories are stored on a network,
in a database, or any facility capable of storing hierarchies of files and directories.
This new ability to decouple resources in the workspace from the local file system is 
called <i>flexible workspaces</i>.
</p>
<p>
Existing clients of <tt>org.eclipse.core.resources</tt> might not support this
new flexibility.  Client code that assumes each <tt>IResource</tt> is located
in the local file system will likely no longer work when resources are stored
in other kinds of file systems.  This guide describes the migration steps
for clients that want to start supporting these new flexible workspaces.
</p>
<h4>IResource.getLocation()</h4>
<p>
The old method <tt>IResource.getLocation()</tt> returns the local file
system path of a resource.  This method no longer works for resources
that are not stored in the local file system.  Most callers of <tt>getLocation()</tt>
did so in order to obtain an instance of <tt>java.io.File</tt>, which can
no longer be used for resources that are not stored in the local file system.
</p>
<p>
The new <tt>org.eclipse.core.filesystem</tt> plugin provides a generic file
system API that can be used in place of <tt>java.io.File</tt>.  In particular,
an instance of <tt>org.eclipse.core.filesystem.IFileStore</tt> provides most
of the same methods that are available on <tt>java.io.File</tt>. The following 
snippet of code obtains an instance of <tt>IFileStore</tt> for a given resource:
<pre>
   IResource resource = ...;//some resource
   IFileStore store = EFS.getStore(resource.getLocationURI());
</pre>
<p>
The following table provides equivalent methods on <tt>IFileStore</tt>
for operations usually done with <tt>java.io.File</tt>:
</p>
<p>
<table border=1>
<th align=left>java.io.File</th><th align=left>IFileStore</th>
<tr><td>delete</td><td>delete</td></tr>
<tr><td>getName</td><td>getName</td></tr>
<tr><td>getParent</td><td>getParent</td></tr>
<tr><td>list</td><td>childNames</td></tr>
<tr><td>mkdir</td><td>mkdir(EFS.SHALLOW, null)</td></tr>
<tr><td>mkdirs</td><td>mkdir(EFS.NONE, null)</td></tr>
<tr><td>renameTo</td><td>move</td></tr>
<tr><td>new FileInputStream(file)</td><td>openInputStream</td></tr>
<tr><td>new FileOutputStream(file)</td><td>openOutputStream</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
In the <tt>IFileStore</tt> API, most information about a file is stored in a 
structure called <tt>IFileInfo</tt>, obtained by calling <tt>IFileStore.fetchInfo()</tt>.
This design allows for greater optimization over code using <tt>java.io.File</tt>,
because many attributes about a file can often be obtained with a single file system
call.  Note that the information in an <tt>IFileInfo</tt> will become stale
if the underlying file is changed, so instances should only be held onto
as long as they are needed.  Here are some methods on <tt>java.io.File</tt>
that have equivalent methods on <tt>IFileInfo</tt>:
</p>
<p>
<table border=1>
<th align=left>java.io.File</th><th align=left>IFileInfo</th>
<tr><td>canWrite</td><td>isReadOnly</td></tr>
<tr><td>exists</td><td>exists</td></tr>
<tr><td>getName</td><td>getName</td></tr>
<tr><td>isDirectory</td><td>isDirectory</td></tr>
<tr><td>isFile</td><td>!isDirectory()</td></tr>
<tr><td>isHidden</td><td>isHidden</td></tr>
<tr><td>lastModified</td><td>getLastModified</td></tr>
<tr><td>length</td><td>getLength</td></tr>
<tr><td>setLastModified</td><td>setLastModified</td></tr>
<tr><td>setReadOnly</td><td>setAttribute(EFS.ATTRIBUTE_READ_ONLY, true)</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
As a concrete example, code that was previously calling <tt>java.io.File.exists()</tt>
can now call <tt>IFileStore.fetchInfo().exists()</tt>.  When a <tt>IFileInfo</tt>
is modified, the result needs to be stored back using the <tt>IFileStore.putInfo</tt>
method. For example, this snippet flips the read only attribute on a file
<pre>
   IFileStore store = ...;//some file store
   IFileInfo info = store.fetchInfo();
   boolean readOnly = info.getAttribute(EFS.ATTRIBUTE_READ_ONLY);
   info.setAttribute(EFS.ATTRIBUTE_READ_ONLY, !readOnly);
   store.putInfo(info, EFS.SET_ATTRIBUTES, null);
</pre>
</p>
<h4>IProjectDescription.getLocation()</h4>
<p>
As with the <tt>getLocation()</tt> method, the project description's location
may no longer be in the local file system.  The method
<tt>IProjectDescription.getLocationURI()</tt> can be used to obtain the location
of a resource in an arbitrary file system.
</p>
<h4>Graceful failure</h4>
<p>
Clients that cannot handle resources outside the local file system may still
want to adapt their code to fail more gracefully. Clients can check if a resource
is in the local file system, and either ignore the resource or alert the user when
they encouter a resource they cannot handle.  To determine if a resource is
in the local file system, you need to find out its file system <i>scheme</i>. 
This can be obtained from a resource as follows:
<pre>
   IResource resource = ...;//some resource
   URI uri = resource.getLocationURI();
   if (uri != null && EFS.SCHEME_LOCAL.equals(uri.getScheme())) {
      //file is in local file system
   } else {
      //file is not in the local file system
   }
</pre>
If you have an <tt>IFileStore</tt> instance in hand, you can obtain the scheme
as follows:
<pre>
   IFileStore store = ...;//a file store
   store.getFileSystem().getScheme();
</pre>
</p>
