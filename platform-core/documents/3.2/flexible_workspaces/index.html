<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
In Eclipse 3.1 and earlier, the <tt>org.eclipse.core.resources</tt> plugin was tightly
coupled with the local file system.  Each project and linked resource was mapped 
to a particular file or directory in the local file system.  In Eclipse 3.2, support
was added to create resources that are stored in an arbitrary file system.
For example, a project can now be created whose files and directories are stored on a network,
in a database, or any facility capable of storing hierarchies of files and directories.
This new ability to decouple resources in the workspace from the local file system is 
called <i>flexible workspaces</i>.
