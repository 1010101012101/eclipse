<h1>Migration guide for <tt>Path</tt> changes</h1>
 
<blockquote> <b>Summary</b>  <br>
Some changes are being made to the <tt>IPath</tt> and <tt>Path</tt>
classes in Eclipse 3.1 to allow for creation of paths containing characters
that were previously invalid.  See the <a href="path_changes_html">proposal</a>
for more details. This document is a draft of a migration guide entry for current
<tt>IPath</tt> users who need to migrate to accomodate these changes.

<h3>Incompatibilities</h3>
<p>
<b>What is affected:</b> Plug-ins that create, manipulate, or store <tt>IPath</tt> objects.
<p>
<b>Description:</b> In Eclipse 3.0, <tt>IPath</tt> had a number of restrictions
on the segments of paths that were more restrictive than the restrictions of the
underlying operating system. These included:
<ul>
<li>Leading and trailing whitespace in path segments were not allowed</li>
<li>The colon character (':') was reserved as a device separator character</li>
<li>The backslash character ('\') was reserved as a segment separator character</li>
</ul>
These restrictions have been removed in Eclipse 3.1 when the platform's data
location (workspace) is located on a file system that does not have these restrictions.

<b>Action required:</b>
