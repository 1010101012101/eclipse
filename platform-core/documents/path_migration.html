<h1>Migration guide for <tt>Path</tt> changes</h1>
 
<blockquote> <b>Summary</b>  <br>
Some changes are being made to the <tt>IPath</tt> and <tt>Path</tt>
classes in Eclipse 3.1 to allow for creation of paths containing characters
that were previously invalid.  See the <a href="path_changes_html">proposal</a>
for more details. This document is a draft of a migration guide entry for current
<tt>IPath</tt> users who need to migrate to accomodate these changes.

<h3>Incompatibilities</h3>
<p>
<b>What is affected:</b> Plug-ins that create, manipulate, or store <tt>IPath</tt> objects.
<p>
<b>Description:</b> In Eclipse 3.0, <tt>IPath</tt> had a number of restrictions
on the segments of paths that were more restrictive than the restrictions of the
underlying operating system. These included:
<ul>
<li>Leading and trailing whitespace in path segments were not allowed</li>
<li>The colon character (':') was reserved as a device separator character</li>
<li>The backslash character ('\') was reserved as a segment separator character</li>
</ul>
These restrictions have been removed in Eclipse 3.1 when the platform's data
location (workspace) is located on a file system that does not have these restrictions.
<p>
<b>Action required:</b> Plug-ins that need to create paths from a given 
<tt>String</tt> in a platform-independent manner will need to migrate to the 
new <tt>Path.fromPortableString</tt> factory method. This method produces
an <tt>IPath</tt> instance from a platform-independent format. This string 
representation of paths can be created using the <tt>IPath.toPortableString</tt> method.
This principally affects plug-ins that store path strings in files that must be readable
on multiple platforms.  This includes all metadata files that are stored inside Eclipse
workspace projects (.project, .classpath, etc), and all paths stored in the preference
store (<tt>org.eclipse.core.runtime.preferences.IPreferencesService</tt>). 
<p>
Plug-ins that were creating paths from hard-coded string literals that assumed 
':' and '\' had special meaning on all platforms will need to migrate. The
solution is to change <tt>String</tt> literals to use the portable path string format,
which interprets the first single colon (':') as the device separator, slash ('/')
as the segment separator, and double colon ("::") as a literal colon character.
<p>
Plug-ins constructing paths using the <tt>IPath.append(String)</tt> method 
that assumed ':' and '\' had special meaning on all platforms will need to migrate.
In Eclipse 3.1, this method uses operating-system specific device and segment
delimiters to interpret the provided path string.
<p>
Note that <tt>fromPortableString</tt> will correctly read all path strings that were
created using the Eclipse 3.0 <tt>IPath.toString</tt> method, but not the
Eclipse 3.1 <tt>toString</tt> method. Thus in most cases no change is required 
to existing metadata file formats except to begin writing paths with <tt>toPortableString</tt>
and reading paths with <tt>fromPortableString</tt>.
