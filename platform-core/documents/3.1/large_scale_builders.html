<p>
The workspace builder infrastructure is designed primarily with efficient
incremental compilers in mind.  Eclipse exposes just two fundamental build
modes: auto-build and manual build.  This simplifies the user experience,
but is not sufficient when a workspace has a mixture of fast and slow builders,
and/or a mixture of small and large projects.  The working set build concept
introduced in Eclipse 3.0 improves the situation, but is still not flexible enough
in some cases.
</p>
<h3>Problem Overview</h3>
<p>
Eclipse-based builders currently provide a number of configuration options
that are not part of the platform builder infrastructure:
<ul>
<li>Each Ant builder instance allows the user to specify if the builder runs
on autobuild, manual build, clean build, or any combination thereof.</li>
<li>CDT provides a per-project setting to specify whether C builders respond
to autobuild ("Build on Resource Save").  This is turned off by default.</li>
<li>The external tools plug-in provides a property page that allows the user
to turn *any* builder on or off completely.</li>
</ul>
These approaches have some problems:
<ul>
<li>
	Out of the box, CDT projects cannot be built.  The workspace auto-build setting
	is on by default, which causes the manual build commands to be disabled in the UI.
	The per-project auto-build setting for C builders is off by default.  Thus there is 
	no UI command available to run them, except for the "Clean" command which is
	always available. This command is not appropriate because it requests that <b>all</b>
	builders discard their built state, preventing them from running incrementally on the
	next build.  If Ant builders are configured to not run on auto-build, they have the same problem.
</li><li>
	Both CDT and Ant builders have per-project auto-build settings, but the
	options have different names and are found in different places.  There is no cohesive
	user experience for these settings.
</li><li>
	Not all plug-ins behave well when they are disabled by the user.  Thus the external
	tool plug-in's "Builders" property page gives the user more control than it should.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The platform needs to introduce more flexibility in how and when builders are
run. This support needs to have the following characteristics:
<ul>
<li>
	The end-user experience out of the box must continue to be simple. Autobuild
	should still be on by default when all existing builders are truly incremental,
	and manual build commands should be disabled.
</li>
<li>
	Flexibility must be controlled. Plug-ins that implement builders must be able
	to specify what kind of flexibility they want to expose to their users.  Builders
	should be able to specify what their out of box behaviour is.
</li>
<li>
	Flexibility, when available, must be presented consistently. The flexibility
	should also not be prominent since it is an advanced feature that shouldn't
	clutter and confuse the UI for basic users.
</li>
<li>
	Build commands in the Project menu and Navigator context menu should
	be available only when appropriate.  Build All should be enabled when
	there are one or more builders in the workspace that do not respond to
	automatic build but do respond to manual builds. Build Project should only be
	available when one or more projects in the current selection has that characteristic.
</li>
</ul>
