		<p> The history store current implementation is said to be problem-prone 
        (data corruption) and hard to maintain. There is an ongoing effort to 
        replace it with something simpler. One of the options would be the adoption 
        of a third-party provided storage engine, such as a embedded database 
        or a b-tree engine. Another is to provide a very simple home-made solution 
        with as little (conceptual/memory/execution) overhead as possible. </p>
		
      <ul>
        <li><p><em>October 29th</em> - tested a file system based solution (<em>take 
          1</em>). Every project has its own history area. History for a file 
          will be stored in a relative directory similar to where the file is. 
          The difference is that, in order to prevent problems with path length 
          limitations on Windows, every segment is translated to a short fixed 
          length string (using a hash function). This opens opportunity for colisions, 
          and it is an one-way translation, so we need to remember the original 
          path for every state. We did this by keeping an additional .info file 
          for each file state to maintain that information. Result: adding new 
          state is really fast, but any tree traversals are very costly (we have 
          to open all .info files in every directory we look).</p></li>
        <li><p><em>November 2nd</em> - tested an improved solution (<em>take 2</em>) 
          based on the previous approach. Instead of keeping an individual .info 
          file showing the original location for every state, we keep a index 
          table per directory. This drastically reduces the number of file openings 
          (not mentioning it takes much less space in the file system), having 
          a better performance for tree based operations. The poor performance 
          for copying history is understandable since we are actually copying 
          the states as well, whereas the original implementation links them (maybe 
          we should do the same). The bad performance when clearing the history 
          for a given resource is due to having to delete multiple files/directories 
          in a more complex directory structure than the original implementation 
          (a two-level tree, directories are never deleted). We could improve 
          that by postponing deleting directories to shutdown (making shutdown 
          slower instead).</p></li>
        <li><p><em>November 17th</em> - using some ideas from the previous tries 
          and the existing code, we got a solution (<em>take 3</em>) that seems 
          to have all the characteristics we have been looking for: it is much 
          simpler than the current story, and generally performs (sometimes much) 
          better than the current implementation. We are using the existing BlobStore 
          (as the existing implementation) and per-bucket indexes, as in the previous 
          solutions. These indexes are just dictionaries having the file path 
          as key and a pair &lt;UUID,timestamps&gt; for every state belonging 
          to the file as value.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>December 13th</em> - the solution above (known as <em>take 3</em>)
        has been part of recent integration builds and will be in for M4. We are currently 
        investigating its use as a replacement for the previous property store implementation as well.
        There are concerns w.r.t. scalability in using a single file to store all properties 
        for all files/folders under a given directory (since properties can be as big as 2K).
        Some sort of segmentation strategy seems necessary to avoid such problems.
