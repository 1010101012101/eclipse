<h1>Eclipse Plug-in Versioning Proposal</h1>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Summary</b> <br>
  The Eclipse team currently changes their plug-in version numbers to match each
    major release of Eclipse (e.g., 2.1, 3.0). This is a convenient
    way of understanding the origin of plug-ins but do not capture the actual
    semantics of the changes which occurred. For
    example, the change from 2.1 to 3.0 indicates a major and incompatible change.
    Of
    course, this
    is
     generally not what was intended as most 3.0 plug-ins are in fact compatible
    with their 2.1 versions. Here we outline the current use of version numbers
    and propose a new process for
    using
    plug-in
    version numbering to better indicate levels of compatibility.<br>

<h2>Problem Definition</h2>
<p>Current Eclipse practice calls for the teams to increment plug-in version numbers
  to match the upcoming release of Eclipse. For example, about 6 months ago we
  changed our plug-in version numbers from 2.1 to 3.0.0. In June 2004 we will
  ship Eclipse 3.0.0 and all plug-ins (save a few third party ones) will be version
  3.0.0. This is convenient because it allows people to look at the plug-in version
number and immediatly understand what version of Eclipse that plug-in is from.</p>
<p>This approach has several drawbacks however</p>
<ul>
  <li>Incrementing the major (first)
      version segment renders the plug-in &quot;incompatible&quot; with
      all previous versions of that plug-in. Dependent plug-ins which specify a version
      number (e.g., &lt;import plugin=&quot;org.eclipse.foo&quot; version=&quot;2.1.0&quot;/&gt;)
      will not resolve against version 3.0.0 of the prerequisite plug-in. Unresolved
      plug-ins cannot participate in a running Eclipse environment. Even though
      we have worked hard to make the content of the 3.0 plug-ins binary backward
      compatible,
      2.1 based third party plug-ins (which specify prereq version numbers) require
    changes to work in 3.0.</li>
  <li>This approach does not set a good example. People building on top of
      Eclipse look to us to understand how they should structure their world.
    Following this
        model, plug-ins like EMF and GEF should increment their version numbers
      to match the Eclipse version numbers regardless of whether they changed
    at all. This
        has the nasty side effect of rendering all of their users incompatible
      as well. It also does not scale well as a little change at the bottom then
      ripples all
      the way up.</li>
  <li> Eclipse is getting away with this because a) we are at the bottom of
      the stack, b) we ship a single wad that is built, packaged and distributed
      in unison
        and c) we do not use version numbered prerequisites ourselves. It is
    really this last point which hurts the most. By not using versioned prereqs,
    we
      are not eating our own dog food. Clearly we do not mean that the resources
      plug-in
        from 3.0 will run on ANY version of the Eclipse runtime. People who build
      and distribute plug-ins are not generally able to play it quite so fast
    and loose.</li>
  <li> Features are not the cure. To address some of this, we use features and
        their abilily to group plug-ins. The assumption is that if the feature
    constraints are met, then the underlying plug-ins will all be happy and thus
    versioned
      plug-in dependencies are not needed. This works but assumes that the feature
      writer
        (may not be related to the plug-in authors) can understand the plug-in
    constraints well enough to define the feature. In practice this means that
    the plug-ins
        in the feature all have similar constraints such that they can be distilled
        to a smaller set of inter feature constraints. Features are a packaging
      mechanism for plug-ins. Pushing constraint satisfaction up to the packaging
      layer puts
        a significant load both on the people creating the packages (e.g., features)
      as well as the packaging (e.g., feature) mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>  To address these concerns, we propose that the Eclipse SDK team start using
    the version number semantics defined by Eclipse for all their plug-ins. The
    numbering process works as follows:- new plug-ins start as 0.0.0 and go through
    various version numbers (&lt;1.0.0)
  until they are ready for their first release. At that time, developers may
  choose to set the version number to 1.0.0. This is mostly cosmetic and is not
  required. Prior to first release the numbering process depends mostly on how
  widely availability and use of the early versions. For example, a beta at 0.9
  sets a good tone and might encourage release at 1.0.0. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Immediately after a release, plug-ins continue with the same number as
    they had in the release (e.g., 1.0.0). </li>
  <li> As the plug-in is developed for the next release, the version number is
    changed to accurately reflect those changes. For example, if some minor fixes
    are done,
      the service (third) segment should be incremented (e.g., 1.0.1). If significant
      but compatible rework is done and/or new function added, the minor (second)
      segment should be incremented. (e.g., 1.1.0). Note that in this example,
    the significant work overshadows the service fixes so the service (third)
    segment
      is set to 0. If major rework is done such that the new version is incompatible
      with previous versions then the major (first) segment should be incremented
      (e.g., 2.0.0) Note that the minor and service numbers are 0 here as well.</li>
  <li> A plug-in's version number need only be incremented to distinguish one
    release from another. For example, if we release 1.0.0 of a plug-in and then
    do some
      bug fixes for a milestone (say M3), we increment the version to 1.0.1.
    If that plug-in were eventually released, people could look at the version
    number and
      see that a) it is different from 1.0.0 and b) that some bug fixes were
    done. If instead, further bug fixes are done for M5, there is no need to
    further
      increment in the version number (i.e., to 1.0.2). Leaving the version at
    1.0.1 still conveys the important information to users of the
    next
    release.
    Of course,  teams could increment the version further if needed/desired.
    Either way, the qualifier (fourth) version segment can be
    used (e.g., 1.0.1.M3
    vs 1.0.1.M5)
      to differentiate between builds of the same version.</li>
  <li> Plug-in version number changes are solely at the discretion of the plug-in
      development team. They are in the best position to understand their changes
      and the scope of impact.</li>
  <li> Features are used to group together plug-ins and label them with a particular &quot;product&quot; release
    version (e.g., 3.0). The org.eclipse.platform 3.0.0 feature contains a complete
    and precise specification of the plug-ins in the 3.0 platform.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Action</h2>
<p>The only action required is to decide we want to do this and refine/document
  the details of the structure and process. There are no technological hurdles.
  Just as teams are responsible updating their copyright dates, they would be
  responsible for incrementing their plug-in versions. These changes are done
  very infrequently so will not be a particular burden.</p>
<p>If we decide to follow this new policy we can retrofit the 3.0 plug-ins with &quot;correct&quot; version
  numbers or start the new approach immediately following the release of Eclipes
  3.0. Starting now avoids situations where Eclipse 2.1 based plug-ins do not
  work on the released 3.0 because of resolution problems (rather than because
  of actual incompatibilities). However, it may adversely affect people in the
  community who have already come to know, like and use the 3.0.0 version numbers.<br>
