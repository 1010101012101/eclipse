      <p>This work is being done in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/equinox">Equinox</a> 
        project.</p>
      <p><i>Plug-in Deactivation </i> - (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36956">36956</a>) 
        In Eclipse plug-ins are activated once referenced and they remain in that 
        state for the duration of the user's Eclipse session. In an effort to 
        reduce memory footprint (amung other reasons) we are investigating allowing 
        plug-ins to become deactivated when they are not being used, and thus 
        that amount of memory could be reclaimed for use by the system.</p>
      <p><i>Incremental Registry Resolution</i> - When a user installs new plug-ins 
        in Eclipse, they are currently forced to restart their system in order 
        for their changes to take effect. This is because currently the plug-in 
        registry is parsed when the system starts up and from that point forward 
        it remains static. We would like to change the plug-in registry resolution 
        to be dynamic, that is to allow the user to add new plug-ins to the system 
        and remove plug-ins from the system at any given point in time and have 
        the system react and behave appropriately.</p>
