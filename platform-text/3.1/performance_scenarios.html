<p>The following set of scenarios contains all those scenarios that we think are 
  important for the overall perception of text related performance by the users. 
  We distinguish between user's first contact, permanent user activities, and 
  rare user activities. User's first contact describes the setup and the activities 
  that reflect the situation when a user starts the system and pursues certain 
  actions for the fist time during that session. Permanent user activities describes 
  the setup and the activities that reflect the situation that the user faces 
  when continuously working with the system. Rare user activities describe the 
  setup and the activities that reflect the situation that the user faces only 
  infrequently but may hamper the user's trust into the system. The numbers behind 
  the subject indicate the importance of the scenario. E.g., typing speed is more 
  important than speed in which the selection can semantically be expanded.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b> Open editor (1)</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li><img src="ok.gif" height=10 width=10 /> Open first text editor in the resource perspective. Measure time until 
      the first user interaction with the newly opened editor is possible.</li>
    <li><img src="ok.gif" height=10 width=10 /> Open first Java editor in the Java perspective. Measure time until the 
      first user interaction with the newly opened editor is possible.</li>
