<p>The Orion project is a proposed open source project under the <a
	href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project_summary.php?projectid=eclipse">Eclipse Project</a>.</p>

<p>This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and
scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse
community. Please send all feedback to the 
<a href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/orion-dev">orion-dev mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<!-- 
	Optionally provide the background that has led you to creating this project.
 -->

<h2>Scope</h2>

<!-- 
	All projects must have a well-defined scope. Describe, concisely, what
	is in-scope and (optionally) what is out-of-scope. An Eclipse project
	cannot have an open-ended scope.
 -->

<h2>Description</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe the project here. Be concise, but provide enough information that
	somebody who doesn't already know very much about your project idea or domain
	has at least a fighting chance of understanding its purpose.
 -->
 
<h2>Why Eclipse?</h2> 

<!-- 
	Answer these two questions:	What value does this project bring to the Eclipse
	community? What value do you expect to obtain from hosting your project at Eclipse?
	
	What value do you get by having your project at Eclipse over and above the value
	of hosting at Eclipse Labs?
 -->

<h2>Initial Contribution</h2>

<!-- 
	Projects are expected to arrive at Eclipse with existing code.
	
	Describe the existing code that will be contributed to the project. Please provide
	a couple of paragraphs describing the code with modest detail, including important
	information like code ownership (who holds the copyright?), and some consideration
	of community that exists around the code. Include a listing of third-party libraries 
	and associated licenses.
 -->
 <p>The initial contribution has been donated by IBM. The current code base has been 
 developed by a handful of developers over a few months. Orion has a fast and scalable 
 code editor that runs on all major desktop browsers. There is a client UI written
 in JavaScript and HTML that has the following capabilities:
 <ul>
 <li>A navigator to browse, search, copy, move, delete, and bookmark files</li>
 <li>A page for launching and managing sites used to test a web application developed with Orion</li>
 <li>A page for launching JavaScript unit tests, and for viewing the test results.</li>
 <li>A page for viewing and editing the user's profile (changing name, password, etc).</li>
 <li>A JavaScript plugin and service registry for installing client-side extensions from different web sites.</li>
 <li>Initial support for git: viewing git status, staging/unstaging changes, and performing commits.</li>
 <li>A compare editor for viewing differences between individual files.</li>
 </ul>
 The contribution also includes an Orion server, providing the following functionality:
 <ul>
 <li>A service for creating and managing user workspaces.</li>
 <li>Services for creating, editing, importing, and exporting files in user workspaces.</li>
 <li>Full text indexing and search using Apache Solr/Lucene.</li>
 <li>Services for Git operations using JGit.</li>
 <li>Authentication and authorization infrastructure, including OpenID login and simple form login support.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
All code in the initial contribution is authored by IBM employees and the copyright is held by IBM.
The initial contribution has the following third party dependencies. Unless otherwise noted,
third party dependencies are licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0.
<ul>
 <li>Apache Solr 1.4, Lucene 2.9, and their prerequisite Apache components.</li>
 <li>Dojo 1.5 (BSD License)</li>
 <li>NekoHTML 0.9.5</li>
 <li>openid4java 0.9.5</li>
 <li>Open AJAX 2.0.3</li>
 <li>org.json 1.0 (JSON Java API License)</li>
 <li>SLF4J 1.6 (MIT license)</li>
</ul>

</p>
 
<h2>Legal Issues</h2>

<!-- 
	Please describe any potential legal issues in this section. Does somebody else
	own the trademark to the project name? Is there some issue that prevents you
	from licensing the project under the Eclipse Public License? Are parts of the 
	code available under some other license? Are there any LGPL/GPL bits that you
	absolutely require?
 -->

<p>
The OpenID4Java library has not yet been approved for use in Eclipse projects. This
library is awaiting further provenance information before it is approved. This library
and associated support for OpenID login can be easily separated from Orion if this
library is not approved.
</p>
<p>
Orion uses a subset of Dojo 1.5 that has been approved for use in Eclipse projects. The
full Dojo library has not been approved for use in Eclipse.
</p>

	List any initial committers that should be provisioned along with the
	new project. Include affiliation, but do not include email addresses at
	this point.

<p>We welcome additional committers and contributions.</p>

<!-- 
	Describe any initial contributions of code that will be brought to the 
	project. If there is no existing code, just remove this section.
 -->

<h2>Mentors</h2>

<!-- 
	New Eclipse projects require a minimum of two mentors from the Architecture
	Council. You need to identify two mentors before the project is created. The
	proposal can be posted before this section is filled in (it's a little easier
	to find a mentor when the proposal itself is public).
 -->

<p>The following Architecture Council members will mentor this
project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mentor 1</li>
	<li>Mentor 2</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interested Parties</h2>

<!-- 
	Provide a list of individuals, organisations, companies, and other Eclipse
	projects that are interested in this project. This list will provide some
	insight into who your project's community will ultimately include. Where
	possible, include affiliations. Do not include email addresses.
 -->

<p>The following individuals, organisations, companies and projects have 
expressed interest in this project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>IBM</li>
	<li>Somebody, Affiliation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Scheduling</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe, in rough terms, what the basic scheduling of the project will
	be. You might, for example, include an indication of when an initial contribution
	should be expected, when your first build will be ready, etc. Exact
	dates are not required.
 -->
