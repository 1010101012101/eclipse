    <td> Eclipse defines a platform with all of the plumbing and infrastructure 
      you need to build most workstation development tools. It includes a resource 
      management system extensible VCM integration, a native-integrated multi-platform 
      widget library called SWT, a UI framework called JFace, and a plug-in architecture 
      for extensibility. Eclipse defines a workbench-style user interface and 
      view management system, and a set of common domain-independent user interaction 
      paradigms that tool builders can plug into to add new capabilities. The 
      platform comes with a set of standard views which can be extended by tool 
      builders. Tool builders can both add new views, and plug new domain-specific 
      capability into existing view... and Eclipse is built using its own plug-in 
      extensibilty architecture - so there are no second-class tools.
      <p>The success of Eclipse depends on how well it enables a wide range of 
        tool builders to build best of breed integrated tools. The Eclipse project 
        is designed to bring the community of tool builders and Eclipse developers 
        together to evolve the Eclipse technology to meet the needs of Eclipse 
        tool builders and their users, so that the vision of Eclipse as an open 
        industry platform is realized.</p>
      <p><br>
        The Eclipse Project consists of three subprojects: the Platform, the Java 
        development tools (JDT), and the Plug-in Development Environment (PDE). 
        Together, they form the Eclipse SDK, a complete development environment 
        for Eclipse-based tools, and for developing Eclipse itself.<br>
