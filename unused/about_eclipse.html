<h2>Introduction to the Eclipse Platform</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Eclipse Platform, enables tool integration by providing a set of common 
  services that are useful across all tools, and a common set of frameworks for 
  building plug-in extensions. Tool integration is based on open APIs and components 
  that provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A common destination to install and integrate tools 
  <li>A central view across all resources and roles providing a base for consistent, 
    effective, efficient, scalable, and end-to-end application development 
  <li>An open, flexible, extensible, standards-based and portable framework for 
    tool integration and interoperability</li>
  <li>A view of the complete application across all components and the entire 
    team</li>
  <li>Standard look-and-feel across all plug-in tools</li>
  <li>Portable, high-performance, platform native look-and-feel</li>
</ul>
<p>This section provides a brief overview of the Workbench services, frameworks, 
  and components. Further details are provided in the sections below.</p>

<h4>Resource Management</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">Resource management services include the workbench, project 
  model, and version and configuration management model. Resource management revolves 
  around the concept of a workbench, which provides the context in which all plug-ins 
  operate, and in which all viewing and editing activities take place. The workbench 
  supports many kinds of resources including resources that represent projects, 
  folders, and files. A project represents a reusable collection of buildable 
  files and folders. A project has a <i>nature</i> which provides the semantics 
  of a project. Project natures specify the builders that are invoked to manage 
  relationships between resources in the project, and how these resources respond 
  to changes in other project resources. A folder provides packaging and namespace 
  management for a collection of files and other folders. A file is the un-interpreted 
  persistent state of some resource. Resources are edited in the local file system 
  in the user’s private workspace, and can be integrated with a workgroup versioning 
  server. <span style="display:none;mso-hide:all"><o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
<h4>Team Programming Model</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Workbench provides support for managing assets in a multi-user, 
  distributed, and perhaps disconnected environment. Users of the workbench create 
  projects in which they do their work. All editing is done in the user’s local 
  workspace. Periodically, a user can release and integrate their work using the 
  team versioning server.</p>
<h4>Debugging</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">The workbench provides a client for full support for distributed, 
  multi-language debugging. The debugger framework provides an extensible architecture 
  for adding support for additional languages. The same debugger user interface 
  can be used across different languages. Debugging is always at the user source 
  level, not at the level of generated code. Specific debugging server implementations 
  on particular languages and platforms (e.g., debugging engines) are not provided 
  as part of the Workbench.</p>
<h4>Extensibility Mechanisms</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Workbench defines a general extension architecture that 
  provides access to publicly available extension mechanisms. This provides controlled 
  access to the open APIs and facilities of the Workbench. Developers can create 
  plug-in extensions to the Workbench and its desktop. Plug-ins may contain a 
  set of extension points that can accept pluggable extensions to encapsulate 
  variability and enable customization by other plug-ins. The extensibility mechanisms 
  also provides support for installing and registering tool extensions. The Workbench 
  allows multiple versions of the same plug-in to coexist at the same time, simplifying 
  plug-in version management and updating. The Workbench also supports the integration 
  of ActiveX controls and OLE Documents on Windows platforms</p>
<h4>Common Frameworks</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Workbench provides a set of reusable frameworks and APIs 
  to facilitate plug-in development. These frameworks provide the infrastructure 
  required to build browsers, editors, and viewers, and allows tool developers 
  to focus on their value add. The frameworks provided are:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Scripting: 
    provides a way of building plug-ins accessing Workbench facilities that use 
    common scripting languages like JavaScript and REXX in HTML documents.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Help: 
    provides support for help content integration and context sensitive help.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Workbench</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Workbench provides the central integration point for 
  plug-in user interfaces through a common view of the complete application across 
  all components and the entire team. This results in a consistent approach for 
  the creation, management, and navigation of resources. The workbench is a plug-in 
  implementing an application integration framework that supports seamless tool 
  user interface integration and controlled openness. A number of common, reusable 
  plug-ins are included with the workbench and may be used by other plug-ins.</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Repository 
    resource navigator: used to create, rename, delete, organize, navigate, and 
    synchronize solutions, projects, folders, and files</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Outline 
    View: a logical extension of the resource navigator that provides an outline 
    view of the contents of a resource</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Tasks 
    View: a view of user or plug-in created tasks that use the marker framework 
    to open and position editors at appropriate points</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Properties 
    View: provides an editor or viewer of resource properties</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Content 
    Area: a managed area of the desktop that is shared by all resource editors</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">The workbench defines a set of key interaction paradigms 
  for working with artifacts (navigator, content outliner, property sheet, problems/tasks, 
  wizards, content edit, debug) to reduced complexity. All content-specific function 
  is provided by plug-ins that integrate with the desktop and with each other.</p>
<h4>Java IDE</h4>
<p>Eclipse also includes a plug-in that provides a full-featured Java IDE. The 
  IDE includes a Java project nature that supports Java editing and debug perspectives. 
  A Java project can specify a classpath that includes other projects as well 
  as external jar and zip files, and directories containing Java class files. 
  The project can also specify the JDK that is to be used to compiler and execute 
  the project. Like all resources managed by the Eclipse workbench, the Java source 
  and class files are files in the user's local file system. Other tools like 
  code generators, beautifiers, etc., can be used on directly on these files.</p>
<p>In addition to the navigator view, the IDE also supports packages and hierarchy 
  views of Java source, class files, jar files, and zip files. The Java editor 
  provides syntax highlighting and code completion based on all Java classes available 
  in the project classpath. The editor is integrated with the outline view to 
  show the methods in a class. A class can be viewed as a whole, or the editor 
  can be configured to only show the method selected in the outline view. All 
  compilation errors are shown in the task view, and double-clicking an error 
  automatically opens the corresponding Java source file and positions the cursor 
  at the error. When the error is corrected and the file is saved, it is removed 
  from the task view.</p>
<p>The Java IDE also provide comprehensive support for refactoring pacakges and 
  classes.</p>
