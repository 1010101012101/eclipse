      <b>Know issues we will be addressing are:</b>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Done:</b> Browsing of modules in "Show Modules" mode by version tag doen't work 
        (see bug <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=22760">22760</a>).</li>
       <p/>
        <li><b>Done:</b> It is difficult to work with Java packages that are defined at the
        root of a repository because Eclispe requires packages to be children of
        a project. The current workaround is to define modules in the
        CVSROOT/modules file. We would like to simplify this by supporting the
        checkout of a folder into an existing project shared with the same
        repository.</li>
       <p/>
        <li><b>Done:</b> By default, the "cvs update" command is always performed with the
        -d option which discovers new or previously unknown directories and loads their contents.
        A property could be added to each project which enables/disables the use of the -d option.</li>
        </li>
       <p/>
        <li><b>Will not be done:</b> Eclipse will automatically purge the CVS folders from any folder that 
        is moved. This behavior could be enhanced as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>If the folder is moved to a project that is not shared with a
            repository, the project could be configured such that CVS operations
            performed on the project would only effect the moved folder.</li>

            <li>If the folder is moved to a project shared with the same repository,
            the folder could be added and the CVS folders maintained.</li>

            <li>If the folder is moved to a project that is mapped to another CVS
            repository or another repository provider, the CVS directories must be
            purged.</li>
          </ol>
        For case 1 and 2, the user would be prompted to carry out the operation
        or purge the CVS information.</li>
      </ul>
