      <td width="98%"> <p><strong>Tag Management</strong></p>
        <p>There are several issues related to how CVS tags are managed in Eclipse</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
            <p>Eclipse needs a remote file to determine the tags for a project. 
              By default, the .project file is used. If this file does not exists 
              remotely, no tags will be displayed until the user performs a Configure 
              Branches and Versions and either selects one or more tags or picks 
              an appropriate file. This is confusing because the UI does not lead 
              the user to perform the configure.</p>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <p>Eclipse shows all known remote tags for a project. The user can 
              remove tags using the Configure dialog but if a refresh is performed, 
              the tags will reappear. A filtering mechanism of some sort would 
              be beneficial.</p>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <p>Eclipse currently only remembers tags for the root folders of a 
              repository. Some repositories are configured such that projects 
              are not located at the repository root. The repository view is of 
              little use in these cases.</p>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <p>Some of the modules defined in the CVSROOT/modules file are not 
              expandable in Eclipse due to the complexity of the module definition. 
              Because of this, tags can not be discovered for the module. This 
              could be rectified if an auto-refresh file could be assigned from 
              another project (one that the user knows is in the module). This 
              problem would go away if all modules could be expanded (but the 
              implementation is complicated by an incomplete spec).</p>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <p>When performing an operation on several projects, the union of 
              the tags are shown. This can cause unexpected behavior if not all 
              projects contain the selected tag.</p>
          </li>
          <li>When performing a Tag with Existing, only tags for the selected 
            project are shown. An option to show all know tags would be helpful 
            for those cases where the user is creating a version or branch of 
            one project to match that of another.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Checkout</strong></p>
        <p>There are currently several menu options available for checking out 
          resources: Checkout as Project, Checkout As..., Checkout Into..., and 
          Checkout Module. These should be consolidated to 2 items: Checkout and 
          Checkout As....</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
            <p>Checkout As should support the functionality provided by Checkout 
              Into.</p>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <p>Checkout as Project and Checkout Module functionality can be combined 
              (i.e. all that is required is multi-select behavior for the Checkout 
              Module logic for it to provide both workflows).</p>
          </li>
          <li>Checkout could be supported on files. The operation would either 
            need to create a suitable container project or allow the user to pick 
            from a list of valid existing projects or folders.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>View Layout</strong></p>
        <p>The Repositories view currently uses a single view to show all remote 
          resource. Also, projects are grouped by branch whereas versions are 
          grouped by project.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>It would be beneficial to support the inverse groupings of what 
              is currently supported (i.e. projects grouped by versions or branches 
              grouped by project). This could be done in the same view or by using 
              alternate views (e.g. a Tag view or a Project view).</p>
          </li>
          <li>Modules and Folders are shown in the same list and differentiated 
            by icon. This can be problematic as it increases the size of the list 
            and a module and folder can have the same name. One suggestion is 
            to provide tabs in the view to show either folders or modules.</li>
        </ul>
