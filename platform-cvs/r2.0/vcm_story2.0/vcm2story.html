<td>by Kevin McGuire&nbsp;
<p>The intention of this document is to describe the overall direction
that VCM (Version Configuration Management) is taking in Eclipse, targeted
at our 2.0 release. It provides a first look into the overall design goals
and strategy we are taking, and includes a first cut of an important interface.
The goal is to initiate discussion in the open source community, and to
garner feedback from repository vendors looking to integrate with Eclipse.
<h3>
Goals</h3>
The goal of the VCM support in the Eclipse Project is to provide a mechanism
by which repository vendors can plug in adapters to integrate the full,
rich, functionality of their repository solution into the Eclipse workbench
in a first class way. The problem with many IDE integration approaches
today is that they provide only a simple and generic level of support that
we feel is an unacceptable level of integration. It does not allow repository
vendors to showcase the unique benefits of their offering and treats repository/IDE
integration as a second class afterthought. By contrast, we believe it
is critically important that the vendor be able to integrate their product's
workflow model into the overall Eclipse user experience. Our success will
be measured by the number of repositories that we can support, by the richness
of this support, and by the degree of VCM integration afforded to third
party plugins.
<h3>
Eclipse VCM 1.0</h3>
While we felt we achieved reasonable CVS support in 1.0, through that process
we understood the places where our model would not translate well to other
repository types. Thus it was a difficult but an absolutely necessary decision
to hold it back from API status in 1.0. The architecture for 2.0 is significantly
different than that in 1.0. For one, the API is smaller. Second, and most
importantly, the workflow in VCM 1.0 was specific to Eclipse and difficult
to customize for a given repository. This led to numerous fundamental problems
in compatibility between the abstract Eclipse VCM model and repositories
with rich models. What resulted was a sort of “least common denominator”
experience that was unsatisfactory to anyone who was already familiar with
the underlying repository model. Third, in many places VCM 1.0 was trying
to be “too helpful” by providing numerous built in mechanisms. While this
potentially allowed rapid integration for some repositories, in general
one ended up having to fight this helpfulness due to subtle semantic differences
between repositories. By contrast, in VCM 2.0 the repository integrator
will always be “in charge”.
<h3>
Approach</h3>
Our technical approach to this problem has two parts - a common base integration
API, together with an extension mechanism. Repository vendors implement
a simple compact base API, which provides basic functionality. The vendor then
uses the extension mechanism to provide a higher level of integration to
achieve the rich integrated experience provided by the unique benefits
of the repository/configuration management/workflow solution. This entails
writing tool plugin views, reusing common views provided by Eclipse, and
integrating vendor specific function into the appropriate extension points
in Eclipse. This approach is consistent with the overall tool integration
strategy for Eclipse, and allows each vendor to decide how rich and how
integrated an experience they will provide to their customers. It also
allows staged development, where increasingly rich plugins can be provided
over time. Further, it allows different adapter implementations to be produced
for the same repository that have different personalities... for example
one could produce a CVS adapter designed for CVS hackers, or another for
novice users. Both work with CVS, but provide different user experiences.
<h3>
Timeline</h3>
Our plan is to have the VCM 2.0 design closed off by end of year, and an
initial cut of our new CVS adapter written for VCM 2.0 in that same time
frame. We are eager to work with repository vendors in the context of the
Eclipse Project at eclipse.org in that same time frame, in order to validate
our design, and to ensure that there will be first class integrations from
the major vendors for the release of Eclipse 2.0.&nbsp;
<h3>
Current State&nbsp;</h3>
The work is still at an early stage and we expect changes to occur, in
particular in the areas of labels (a.k.a. tags). We want this API evolution
process to be driven by the requirements of repository vendors. By mid
November we hope to be releasing to dev.eclipse.org a preliminary code
drop that could be used for prototyping repository providers. We expect
that this will help clarify the story, since code speaks louder than words.&nbsp;
<h3>
Architecture</h3>
The VCM 2.0 story can be broken down into the following pieces.&nbsp;
<p><b>VCM Core</b>
<ul>
<li>
VCM 2.0 will provide a base API (ITeamProvider interface, included below)
representing the core set of VCM operations.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
All providers must implement this interface.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
An Eclipse project will be associated with one and only one ITeamProvider
instance.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
There will be support for looking up an ITeamProvider instance given a
project.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
In effect, ITeamProvider describes the abstract VCM model that other plugins
can rely on for performing repository neutral operations. For example,
a headless ISV consumer of this API could use it for writing build tools,
code generation, etc. It is up to each repository vendor to implement this
interface within the prescribed pre and post conditions, mapping the operations
onto their native repository function.&nbsp;
<p><b>VCM UI</b>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
There will be a mechanism by which a provider can offer up a Team menu
that other plugins can include in their views. There will be a standard
menu which a provider may choose to use wholly, supplement with additional
operations, or replace entirely.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Through this menu mechanism VCM acts as the intermediary between the third-party
plugin that wishes to include VCM operations in their view, and the provider
for that project who can offer up a Team menu specific to the workflows
of their repository type. This allows repository specific VCM operations
to be populated in views where the plugin writer and the repository provider
don't know about each other.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
VCM will supply some standard views that repository providers may wish
make use of. At present this list includes the Synchronization view from
Eclipse 1.0 and the History view. In order to use these views, the repository
provider will need to conform to additional APIs. Customization or subclassing
may also be required. This offers a code reuse story for leveraging common
views so that all repository providers don't need to write each from scratch.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Alternatively, providers may wish to write their own custom views. This
might be required in cases where the provider is unable to conform to the
additional API, or in cases where the provider wishes to supply a view
which is either richer or works substantially different than the Eclipse
VCM supplied view. In all cases, it is the provider who is in charge.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Decorators can be implemented to show VCM related information of a resource,
for example in the Eclipse navigator.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
There will be an update mechanism to inform listeners of changes to the
implied VCM properties (e.g. whether a resource is checked out or not).
This would be used, among other places, to update the resource decorators
above.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>
The figure below shows this architectural separation for two suggested repositories, CVS and ClearClase.
</p>

<img SRC="image001.gif">

<p>
The dashed boxes denote those pieces that a repository integrator must implement.  
For example for ClearCase, one would implement the VCM Core APIs, as 
denoted by the box CC Impl, as well as certain UI components, as denoted by 
CC UI. The vendor has opportunity to make repository specific calls in order to 
support their UI components. However, third party tools remain agnostic with 
regards to individual repository APIs and semantics. 
The amount of effort required to implement the UI pieces will depend whether one 
wishes to leverage the Eclipse VCM supplied UI components, or whether one wishes 
to implement custom UI components that better express the workflow of that repository type.
Together, the VCM Core and UI architectures provide the pervasiveness required 
for a well-integrated VCM experience, with the customization required for rich 
repository integration.

ITeamProvider, the 'core' API described previously. As mentioned earlier,
this is just a first cut and will be undergoing change. Other APIs supporting
associating a provider with a project, looking up a provider for a project,
Synchronization view, History view, and decorators will be coming.
