          ElementTree motivation
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Typical edit/compile/deploy cycle for a developer focuses on a small segment of a potentially very large code base
          </li>
          <li>
            Want to aggressively optimize for this common cycle: make performance cost proportional to the change, rather than to the size of the workspace
          </li>
          <li>
            Create and manipulate &quot;units of change&quot; that are passed around to interested parties

          Additional observations
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Clients want a delta of the workspace state between two moments in time</li>
          <li>Different clients may want deltas with different start and/or end points</li>
          <li>May need to keep track of hundreds of tree states at once</li>
          <li>How to efficiently represent all these different deltas in memory?</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Have only one complete tree, and represent all others as deltas</li>
          <li>Only one delta is mutable - representing current operation</li>
          <li>Immutability allows trees to share common parent and nodes to share children</li>
          <li>Each tree seems complete when traversing using API, but internal structure quite different</li>
          <li>Computing deltas is nearly free for most common operations</li>

        <h3>
          Lessons learned
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Not all optimization is a speed-space tradeoff. Here we greatly reduced space required to represent states, and made delta calculation very fast</li>
          <li>Textbook data structures work very well in most programming situations, but sometimes 
          a very specialized structure is called for</li>
          <li>Internal representation of a data structure can be radically different from external appearance</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Incrementally adding functionality over time can reach a breaking point where 
            you need a fundamental rethink</li>
          <li>Creating a pure "model" layer between user inputs and resulting behaviour was very powerful</li>
          <li>Different parts of the problem could be isolated and optimized</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Update manager only resolved feature dependencies</li>
          <li>Features: once installed, always installed</li>
          <li>A feature you don't really care about can block install of something you really want</li>
          <li>Resolving dependencies could sometimes be slow but was generally usable</li>
          <li>Redundant expression of dependencies at feature and plugin level was a source of bugs</li>

        <h3>Observations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Some installed things are "roots" that the user chose to install, 
other things are installed only to satisfy dependencies	</li>
          <li>In p2 we wanted to ensure all dependencies were satisfied - feature, bundle, and package level</li>
          <li>This is an NP hard constraint satisfaction problem, and our hand-crafted resolver wasn't good enough</li>

        <ul>

          <li>Is there a set of variable assignments that will satisfy all expressions</li>

c := Plugin B 1.1
