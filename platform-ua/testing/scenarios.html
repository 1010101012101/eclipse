Testing Scenarios for Help System</h1>
<h2>
<b>Objectives</b></h2>
This is a quick run through most of the end-user functionality of the
eclipse
help system and the info-center scenario. The following are the main
focus
areas for testing help:
<ol>
  <li>
integration with the workbench: launching help browser and help view
from help menu, help search,
and context-sensitive help (F1)</li>
  <li>
navigation and browsing of topics in the help browser and view<br>
  </li>
  <li>
search support in the help browser and view<br>
  </li>
  <li>
accessibility</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>
Integration with the workbench</h3>
These tests exercise interactions with help system from workbench.
<p>I1: Help browser preferences:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
Launch "Window"-&gt;"Preferences".&nbsp; Preferences dialog will open.</li>
  <li>Choose "Help" on the left.&nbsp; This should show help preference
page
on the right</li>
  <li> On Windows and Linux help uses embedded browser, and the
preference should contain a checkbox to use external browser.</li>
  <li>
Choose "Help"-&gt;"Help" Contents" from the workbench menu, ensure a
browser
opens and displays Help browser.</li>
  <li>
Go back to help preferences, select "Use external browser".&nbsp;
Follow hyperlink to Workbench Browsers preference page.&nbsp; Choose a
browser to use, Click "OK".</li>
  <li>
Choose "Help"-&gt;"Help" Contents" from the workbench menu, ensure a
browser selected
opens and displays Help.</li>
  <li>
Go back to help preferences.&nbsp; If you have more browser adapters
available,
try selecting each browser adapter and launch help.</li>
</ol>
I2: Displaying help preferences:
<ol>
  <li>
Press "F1" key (Ctrl+F1 on GTK, Help on carbon) in the workbench
"Navigator" view
("Resources" perspective).
This should open help view in the workbench, turned to Related Topics
page.&nbsp; Verify "About ..." section displays description of
workbench part in focus.</li>
  <li>Click on one of the related links.&nbsp; A topic should open in
the help view.</li>
  <li>Change help preferences to open context help in an infopop,
dialog context help in an infopop, help view document open mode - in
editor.</li>
  <li>Click "back" in the help view to arrive at Related Topics
page.&nbsp; Select a link from Dynamic Help section.&nbsp; Verify it
opens in the editor area.</li>
  <li>Press "F1" key (Ctrl+F1 on GTK, Help on carbon) in the workbench
"Navigator" view
("Resources" perspective) again.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <>This time it should open an infopop with a description and related
links.&nbsp; Focus
should be on the first link ("Views").</>
  <li>Click "Navigator View" link.&nbsp; This should launch help web
browser,
and display "Navigator View" document on the right and the list of
related
topics on the left.&nbsp; The link called "Navigator View" should be
selected.</li>
  <li>Open help preferences, press "F1".&nbsp; and infopop should open.</li>
  <li>Restore defaults in the the browser preference page, and apply.</li>
  <li>Press F1 again.&nbsp; A small help view with Related Topics
should open adjacent to the preferences dialog.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
I3: Opening / closing help browser:
<ol>
  <li>
Without closing the browser that opened in test case I1.4, choose
"Help"-&gt;"Help"
Contents" from the workbench menu.&nbsp; No new browser window should
launch,
and the existing help browser should load the table of contents, with
lists
of books on the left, and "Welcome to Eclipse help" document on the
right.</li>
  <li>
Close the help browser.&nbsp; Browser window should close.</li>
  <li>Open a workbench preferences, press F1 (Ctrl+F1 on GTK, Help on
carbon). Select a related link. Help should open in external browser
(even when help preference "always use external browser" checkbox is
present on preference page and deselected).</li>
</ol>
I4: Search:
<ol>
  <li>
Choose "Hep Search" from the workbench Help menu.&nbsp; Click "Help
Search" tab.&nbsp; Help search page should open.</li>
  <li>
Type a query "open project" (without quotes), click "Go".</li>
  <li>Choose a result.&nbsp; The document should open with occurrences
of the words "open" and "project" highlighted.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
I5:&nbsp; Search filtering:
<ol>
  <li>TODO</li>
</ol>
I7:&nbsp; Live help:
<ol>
  <li>
Type "active link below" (no quotes) in the search field in the help
view,
and search.</li>
  <li>
Choose a document titled "Active help" from the search results.</li>
  <li>
Click once "Click here for a Message" link at the bottom of the
document.</li>
  <li>Ensure that a "Hello World" is being
displayed in a dialog on top of the workbench.</li>
</ol>
I8:&nbsp; Appserver preferences:
<ol>
  <li> Launch "Window"-&gt;"Preferences".&nbsp; Preferences dialog will
open.</li>
  <li> Choose "Help/Help Server" on the left.&nbsp; Enter a port number
(for example 2003), in the second field.&nbsp; Click O.K.</li>
  <li> Restart workbench. Launch help from the menu.&nbsp; Ensure
browser opens and displays help content.</li>
  <li> Go back to Help Server preferences, click "Restore defaults"
button, click "OK", restart workbench.</li>
</ol>
I9:&nbsp; Workbench Capabilities
in Help
<ol>
  <li> Launch "Window"-&gt;"Preferences".&nbsp; Open
"General"-&gt;"Capabilities" preference page.</li>
  <li>Select all capabilities and deselect "Development".</li>
  <li>Launch help , by selecting Help-&gt;Help Contents from the
menu.&nbsp; Verify only two workbench books appear.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Select "Show All Topics" button in the navigation toolbar.&nbsp;
Confirm.</li>
  <li>Verify "Show All Topics" toolbar button appears pressed, and all
books (including PDE Guide are displayed).</li>
  <li>Search for "PDE".&nbsp; There should be large number of hits<br>
  </li>
  <li> Turn off showing all topics. Verify that PDE Guide disappeared,
since it is does not belong to enabled workbench capabilities.</li>
  <li>Perform search for "PDE". Verify search results were redisplayed
and there are no or next to no results.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>
Navigation and browsing</h3>
The main things to look for here are:
<ul>
  <li>
moving around the navigation views (Contents, Search Results, Links,
Bookmarks)</li>
  <li>
opening a book, expanding/collapsing/selecting topic nodes</li>
  <li>
navigating links inside the help pages</li>
  <li>
using toolbar actions for displaying the main table of contents, for
hiding or maximizing the navigation frame, for topic/navigation
synchronization, printing</li>
  <li>
performing simple searching.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: this test is to be done on browser adapters that are based on
Internet Explorer or Mozilla. For other browser, refer to the "basic"
test.</p>
<p><br>
N1: Basic topic navigation:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
Launch help from the workbench menu: Help-&gt;Help Contents. This
should open
the help view to the main bookshelf that lists the available books.</li>
  <li>
In the Contents page select the Workbench User Guide book. This should
expand that book and show it contents. All the other books must still
be available in the navigation frame (i.e. only the select book
expands).</li>
  <li>
In the table of contents tree navigate to Concepts -&gt;Workbench.
Selecting the "Workbench" topic should show some content in the main
help area.</li>
  <li>
Click on the "Features" link in the displayed document.
This should load a new document.</li>
</ol>
N2: Document toolbar actions:
<ol>
  <li>Identify the 6 buttons on the content toolbar (the toolbar is
located above
the page displaying help pages): Go Back, Go Forward, Show in table of contents,
Bookmark document, Print Page, and Maximize.</li>
  <li>Click the Back button in the content toolbar. This should reload
the previous document (Workbench).</li>
  <li>Click the Forward button in the content toolbar. This should
reload the
document ("Features").</li>
  <li>Click maximize icon on the toolbar of the main content frame.
This should maximize that particular frame, and "Restore" icon should
be shown in place of "Maximize". This time double click on the toolbar,
it should restore the original layout. The behavior should be similar
to that of the eclipse views.</li>
  <li>Click on the "Synchronize Navigation" button on the toolbar. This
should highlight the "Features" topic in the navigation tree.</li>
  <li>Print the topic by clicking on the "Print Page" button on the
toolbar. This should launch the system print dialog and if you click OK
it should print the help page</li>
  <li>Bookmark the current page, by pressing the "Bookmark document"
button on the toolbar.</li>
  <li>Turn to the Bookmarks tabs and verify it is added there.</li>
  <li>Turn to the Contents tab and select another topic</li>
  <li>Turn to the Bookmarks tab and click on the bookmarked topic
(Features). This should load that topic in the main content area.</li>
  <li>Remove bookmark: Select the bookmark topic, right click and
select Remove, or choose "Delete bookmark" from the bookmark view
toolbar.</li>
  <li>Add more bookmarks, delete them all using "Remove all bookmarks"
button or action on the pop-up menu.</li>
</ol>
N3: Searching documentation, basic scenario:
<ol>
  <li>
In the Search entry field enter the word "participation" without the
double
quotes. The navigation frame should turn to the Search Results view,
and if this was the
first time you search the docs, you should see the indexing progress
monitor
in that page. When indexing is finished (or right away if other
searches
were performed before) you should get the results. In my case, I got 14
hits, starting with "Synchronize View Integration".</li>
  <li>
Select a search result: "Workspace save participation". You should
see the "participation" string highlighted, as well as "particip". This
is because the search engine
uses word stemming on English, so the highlighting respects the same
stemming
algorithm.</li>
  <li>
Click on each results. You should see the toolbar title changing to
show
the book containing the document.</li>
  <li>
Let's narrow the results by book: click on the "Scope" link in the
search
bar. This should launch the Select Scope Search dialog that let's use
define search list. Click on "New" to launch the dialog for defining a
new search list. Enter the name "workbench" and select the "Workbench
User Guide", click OK to close the dialog. The name "workbench" should
now be visible in the list in the Select Scope Search dialog. Select
it, and click OK (or double click instead).</li>
  <li>
This should close the dialog and the Search Scope should now display
the name "workbench". Note: Sometimes the search bar is not updated
right away, so you may have to wait a bit. Search again for the same
word, "participation". You should see fewer results (I see 2 hits only).</li>
  <li>
Select the "Crash recovery" hit, and click on "Synchronize Navigation"
button
on the navigation or content toolbar. This should switch the navigation
view
to
the
Contents
view, and expand the Workbench User Guide down to the "Crash recovery"
topic.</li>
  <li>
Click the "Search Results" tab at the bottom of the navigation tree.
This
should redisplay the search result you've seen in step 5.</li>
  <li>
Click on the "Contents" tab at the bottom of the navigation tree. This
should redisplay the navigation tree as you left it after step 6.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Search</h3>
This part test support for advanced search.&nbsp; Perform search either
from "Help" page on Eclipse "Search" dialog opened by
"Search"-&gt;"Search..." and
turning to Help page
or from the browser opened by "Help"-"Help Contents".
<p>S1: Boolean search:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
Search for 'project close' (no quotes).&nbsp; Documents should be found
containing both words.&nbsp; Selecting document should show its
contents
with occurrences of both words highlighted.</li>
  <li>
Search for 'project AND close' (no quotes).&nbsp; The results should be
same as for the previous query</li>
  <li>
Search for 'project OR close' (no quotes).&nbsp; The list of hits
should
be much longer, with some documents at the top containing both words,
and
documents down the list containing only one of them.</li>
  <li>
Search for 'project close not navigator' (no quotes).&nbsp; The list of
hits should be smaller than in step 1 of test S1.</li>
</ol>
S2: Exact search:
<ol>
  <li>
Search for ' "close project" ' (in double quotes).&nbsp; The search
results
list should be shorter than in step 1 of test S1.</li>
  <li>
The documents should contain consecutive words close and project
(possibly
separated by a punctuation).</li>
</ol>
S3: Search scope
<ol>
  <li>
Search for 'close project' (no quotes).&nbsp; The search results list
will
show hits.</li>
  <li>
Select a document.&nbsp; Note the book the topic belongs to.&nbsp; The
book name is displayed on the toolbar in the browser, directly above
the
document.</li>
  <li> Click "Search scope:".&nbsp; The scope selection window will
open.&nbsp;
Click "New", Select some books or sections, but leave the book that was
noted in step 2 of test S3 unchecked.</li>
  <li>
Type a name for your new scope.&nbsp; Close dialog windows, ensure that
the scope name appears on the search tool bar.</li>
  <li>
Click "Go".&nbsp; Verify that the document selected in step 3 of test
S2
does not appear in the list of search results.</li>
  <li>Click the Search Scope again and remove the scope you just
defined. Click OK to close the dialog. The search bar should now have
"All topics" in the Search Scope.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Customization</h3>
<p>C1: Help preferences / large book browsing
</p>
Create a file plugin_customization.ini in the root of Eclipse
installation.<br>
<p>Edit the file and paste the following key/values pairs:
</p>
<p>org.eclipse.help/baseTOCS=/org.eclipse.pde.doc.user/toc.xml,/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv/toc.xml<br>

</p>
<ol>
  <li>Launch Eclipse, pointing to the ppreferences customization, e.g.
eclipse -pluginCustomization plugin_customization.ini</li>
  <li>From the workbench menu: Help-&gt;Help Contents. This should open
the help browser. Verify existence of banner frame above search toolbar.</li>
  <li> The page displayed in the content frame should be eclipse.org

  <li>There should be only two Eclipse books displayed PDE Guide and
JDT Development Guide, in that order.&nbsp; Other Eclipse books should
not appear.</li>
  <li>Search for "workbench".&nbsp; Verify there are no hits from
Workbench User Guide that is not present.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Verify there is only Contents and Search tabs at the bottom of
navigation frame, other views (Links and Bookmarks) are not present.</li>
  <li> Verify the browser title shows product name.</li>
  <li>Browse navigation tree. There can be small delay expanding
second, fourth, etc level of topics. Verify branches expand correctly.</li>
  <li>Verify help UI background is yellow, and green in the toolbars.</li>
  <li>Verify fonts are bold in the toolbars, and italic in the rest of
the UI.</li>
  <li>Launch "Window"-&gt;"Preferences".&nbsp; Open

document.</li>
  <li>Verify a message informing that active help is not enabled is
displayed, and "Hello World" workbench dialog does not appear.</li>
</ol>
<p>C2: BIDI
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Launch eclipse passing "-dir rtl" option on the command line.
Open Help.</li>
  <li>Verify Help UI is rendered right to left.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
Accessibility support should test for how the help view
<ul>
  <li>
uses system colors and fonts,</li>
  <li>
uses browser's accessibility support,</li>
  <li>
can be navigated using only the keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<b>Note: Platform considerations for the accessibility tests:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>on Windows things should work as described;</b></li>
  <li>
    <b>on Linux using the Mozilla browser adapter keyboard navigation
works slightly
different: Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab are to be replaced by Ctrl-F6
and Ctrl-Shift-F6
(this is for frame navigation, see below).</b></li>
  <li>
    <b>on Solaris/AIX/HP, unless you use Mozilla, the default browser
adapter
for Netscape 4.x has very little accessibility support, both for
fonts/colors
and for keyboard navigation.</b></li>
</ul>
A1: System colors and fonts:
<ol>
  <li>
Observe if the colors and fonts match your system settings. Window
backgrounds
for navigation views (Contents/Search Results/Links/Bookmarks) should
match the
system window color (usually white on Windows and gray on Linux). The
toolbars
should match the button face co lour (usually gray). The font should
match
the system icon font. Highlight co lour should match the system
highlight co lour.</li>
  <li>
Change your system colors/font settings and see if the changes take
effect.</li>
  <li>
On Windows, try the high contrast settings: Control Panel -&gt;
Accessibility
Options -&gt; Display - &gt; Use high contrast.</li>
</ol>
A2: Browser accessibility support:
<ol>
  <li>
Windows: in IE - &gt; Tools-&gt; Internet Options -&gt; General
-&gt;Accessibility
play with the settings for Format. Help should behave accordingly.</li>
  <li>
DO NOT turn off style sheet support, help will not work well.</li>
</ol>
A3: Navigation with keyboard only:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the keyboard navigation rules
for help (as supported by browsers):
<blockquote>
  <p>- To move to the next topic in the left frame, press TAB or DOWN
arrow. <br>
- To move to the previous topic , press SHIFT-TAB or UP arrow. <br>
- To expand/collapse a tree node press RIGHT/LEFT arrow. <br>
- Press Enter to select a topic and have its content displayed <br>
- To scroll all the way up/down press HOME/END. <br>
- To go back/forward press ALT-LEFT/RIGHT ARROW <br>
- To go to the next frame (there are quite a number of frames in the
help <br>
system) press CTRL-TAB (On Mozilla 1.2 press Ctrl-F6). <br>
- To move to previous frame, press SHIFT-CTRL-TAB (On Mozilla &gt;1.2
press Ctrl-Shift-F6).<br>
- To move to content frame, press ALT-K, and press Tab to place focus
inside the topic<br>
- To print the current page or active frame, press CTRL-P.</p>
</blockquote>
A4: F1 infopop keyboard accessibility:
<ol>
  <li>
Press F1 (on GTK - Ctrl-F1, on carbon - Help key) in the workbench
Navigator view (Resources perspective). This should launch the infopop
with some text and two related links. Focus should
be on the first link ("Views"). Click and the help view should open to
the selected topic.</li>
  <li>
Get back to the workbench and press F1 again, in the Navigator view.
When the
infopop comes up, press down/up arrows (or tab) to cycle around the
links. Press Esc to dismiss
the infopop.</li>
</ol>
A5: On Windows, use Windows Narrator (or JAWS if installed ), repeat
the
same
tests
and
see
if
description an links read out correctly.<br>
<br>
<h3>Other Scenarios</h3>
<p>In addition to the eclipse workbench help scenario, there are two
other
help uses scenarios: <a
 href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/help_standalone.html">standalone
help</a> and <a
 href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/help_infocenter.html">info-center</a>
(server based) help.<br>
<br>
<br>
IC: Infocenter</p>
<ol>
  <li>Assuming eclipse is installed as d:\eclipse, change directory to
d:\eclipse and run the following command: java -cp
plugins/org.eclipse.help.base_3.1.0.jar
org.eclipse.help.standalone.Infocenter -command start -data infocenter
-port 8888</li>
  <li>Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8888/help. You
should see the help system, but without the links and bookmarks tabs.</li>
  <li>Define a working set, search help. Close the browser and reopen.
Verify working sets are remembered.</li>
  <li>Perform ad-hoc testing or follow the steps for the regular
workbench scenarios, with the exception of bookmarks, infopop and
active help.</li>
  <li>Shutdown the infocenter by running: java -cp
plugins/org.eclipse.help.base_3.1.0.jar
org.eclipse.help.standalone.Infocenter -command shutdown -data
infocenter</li>
</ol>
<p><br>
SA: Stand-alone help
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Assuming eclipse is installed as d:\eclipse, change directory to
d:\eclipse and run the following command: java -cp
plugins/org.eclipse.help.base_3.1.0.jar
org.eclipse.help.standalone.Help -command displayHelp -data standalone</li>
  <li>The above command should automatically open the browser so you
can browse the help. Perform ad-hoc testing or follow the steps in the
regular workbench scenario, with the exception of infopop and active
help.</li>
  <li>Shutdown the standalone help by running: java -cp
plugins/org.eclipse.help.base_3.1.0.jar
org.eclipse.help.standalone.Help -command shutdown -data standalone</li>
</ol>
<p><br>
B: Basic help ui (any browser with Javascript disabled or browsers
other than IE, Mozilla or Netscape6+)
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Disable javascript in the browser that is used by the default
browser adapter (normally, that's IE on Windows, Mozilla on Linux and
Netscape6+ on others)</li>
  <li>Launch help and you should see a simple 3-frame layout with links
instead of tabs and just the synchronize navigation button available.
Books are always expanded and there is no state preservation across
views (i.e. when switching between contents/links/search/bookmarks) the
page always reloads)</li>
  <li>Try ad-hoc testing or follow the regular workbench scenario steps
above.</li>
  <li>Instead of step 1, you can launch Netscape 4.7 and navigate to
the help system URL. To get this URL, right click in the help browser
and select "Properties". Check what the URL is.</li>
</ol>
