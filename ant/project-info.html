			The Ant component is designed to bring the power of Ant and Eclipse together. 
			Ant is a Java based build tool. In theory it is kind of like make without 
			make's wrinkles. It exists independent of Eclipse as an <a target="_blank" href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_top">Apache 
			open source project</a>. Integrating Ant into Eclipse means:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Executing Ant buildfiles from Eclipse</li>
			<li>Enabling access to Eclipse resources/function from Ant buildfiles (i.e., 
  				providing Ant tasks for Eclipse)</li>
			<li>Providing UI support for running Ant buildfiles and managing their output</li>
			<li>Providing Ant buildfile development facilities (e.g., buildfile editors, 
  				debuggers, ...)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The goal of this component is to make Eclipse's Ant tooling the environment 
			of choice for Ant users and support Eclipse-based developers in their 
			product build requirements.
