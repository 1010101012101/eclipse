<span style="font-weight: bold;">Contributing a port to an Eclipse build</span><br>
<i><b>DRAFT </b></i>
<p>Last updated: Sept 14, 2005</p>
<br>
<p> 
The Eclipse platform team has limited hardware and platform resources
to compile and produce builds of Eclipse on a wide variety of
platforms. This document describes the mechanism to provide a build for
a operating system-windowing system-architecture (os-ws-arch) that is
not currently built by the platform team. 
<p>There are two types of builds that
  can be contributed:

<p>
<h3>1.  PMC approved contributed builds</h3>
<p>In assuming this role, teams
    or individuals will be expected to perform the following tasks.&nbsp; <br>
<ul>
  <li>Meet eclipse.org&nbsp; <a href="http://eclipse.org/legal/">legal
requirements.</a></li>
  <li>Contribute patches required for build and run Eclipse on the
new platform<br>
    <a href="http://eclipse.org/legal/"></a></li>
  <li>Run the build and conduct automated tests at a regular intervals. </li>
  <li>Resolve platform specific bugs<br>
  </li>
  <li>Upload a tested build for inclusion in upcoming Eclipse
platform milestones and releases to the eclipse.org infrastructure.<a
 href="http://eclipse.org/legal/"></a><br>
  </li>
</ul>
These conditions must be met before a port will be provided on eclipse.org.<br>
<br>
The process to include an external build on eclipse.org is as follows:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Open a <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs">bug</a> with the
    Product Platform and Component Releng describing the os-ws-arch drop and
    type of
    drop you intend to provide.
For instance, will you provide the SDK only?&nbsp; Or will you provide
both the SDK and platform runtime.&nbsp; The platform releng team will
arrange for PMC approval of support of this new drop. Once approved, a 
new project may need to be created to provide swt libraries for this
platform.
You
will also need to be approved as a committer by the PMC to have commit
rights to new platform-specific libraries
required by your contributed platform build. As part of this progress, you will
also
agree to the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/committerguidelines.html">committer
  due diligence guidelines</a>.</li>
  <li>Once approval is granted, use the&nbsp; <a
 href="http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/S-3.1M4-200412162000/srcIncludedBuildInstructions.html">Source
Build</a> or <a
 href="http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/S-3.1M4-200412162000/srcFetchBuildInstructions.html">Source
Fetch build</a> scripts to generate a build if you are contributing the
SDK only.&nbsp; If you are interested in contributing other components,
please use the instructions to generate a <a
 href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder/readme.html?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/html">
Eclipse components from the command line using Ant scripts in this
project and org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder.</a> Incorporate platform
specific patches in these scripts and test the resultant build.&nbsp; A
bug describing the patches to ensure that the build runs should be
opened with Product Platform and Component Releng.&nbsp; We will
incorporate these patches into our build scripts or ensure that they
are included in other teams code base as appropriate.  </li>
  <li>The cvs tag of&nbsp; the builder projects (org.eclipse.releng,
org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder and org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder)
that was used to create the build will be listed on the test results
page of the build. Refer to the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-releng-home/buildSchedule.html">platform
releng build schedule</a> if you need additional information about upcoming builds </li>
  <li><a mailto="webmaster@eclipse.org">Run the automated tests for
your platform after you have
successfully completed the build.</a></li>
  <li>Request a ftp account on download1.eclipse.org from <a
 href="mailto:webmaster@eclipse.org">
webmaster@eclipse.org</a>  </li>
  <li>Copy the build to the staging area for eclipse downloads. </li>
  <p></p>
  <tt>/home/data/httpd/download-staging.priv/eclipse/downloads/&lt;your organization&gt;</tt>
  <p>
  <li>Once you have pushed your
  files to the server, notify the releng team that your file available.  They
    will move it to the appropriate directory so it's available for download
    from eclipse.org.
    <p></li>
</ol>
    <h3>2. Other contributed builds</h3>
  
    <p>If you would like to have your custom build listed on eclipse.org, we
      welcome your contribution. Please provide the following information in
      your <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs">bug</a>:</p>
    <li>A link to download your publicly available build.</li>
    <li>The ws-os-arch platform of the build</li>
    <li>The source that was used to generate this build, for example 3.2 M2</li>
    <li>Instructions on how to reproduce the build</li>
<li>How to contact the author.</li>

  <p>Platform specific bugs for these builds will not be investigated by the
    eclipse platform committers unless they can be reproduced on an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_2.html#TargetOperatingEnvironments">eclipse
reference platform</a></p>
