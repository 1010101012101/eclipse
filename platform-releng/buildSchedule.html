  N builds replace tags specified in org.eclipse.releng map files with HEAD.<br>
I builds use tags org.eclipse.releng map files.
<br>M builds use tags in the R3_1_maintenance
branch of org.eclipse.releng. 
<br>Teams must update map files in time for I and M build start times.<br>
  Performance testing will only occur where indicated.</p>
<p>Times are all EDT (GMT +5)</p>

<tr> <td align=LEFT valign=TOP colspan="2" bgcolor="#0080C0"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#FFFFFF">Build 
Notes </font></b></td></tr> <tr> <td height="19"> We have decided to make some 
minor changes in our build story in order to better focus the responsibility for 
getting good integration builds on the developers: <p>For the 3.2 integration
  
builds: <br>
 - build time is 8:00 am (Eastern time) on Tuesday mornings. <br> 
- in the event of an integration build failure due to compile errors, missing 
plugins or if the drops are not posted,<br>there will be a same day rebuild upon 
submission of a fix.<br> - Otherwise, there will be a rebuild at 8 am Wednesday morning
to accommodate fixes that have a workaround or do not impact the general usability of the build.  <br>-Teams are expected to indicate on the platform-releng-dev mailing list if they intend to contribute to a rebuild. <br> - in the event of a double integration build failure, all other 
work will stop until <br> guaranteed-to-be-successful build contributions are 
prepared for a rebuild at 8:00 am Thursday morning. <br> - if the Thursday 8:00 
am (Eastern time) integration build fails we will rebuild until success<br> - 
once a good integration build is achieved, it will be marked as such on the website. 
<br> -the releng team will often request a go/no go status from all teams to determine 
if the build is suitable for the week's testing. If you provide status and then 
recontribute to a subsequent build, you are required to revalidate the build and 
provide an updated status.</p>
<p>For the 3.1.1 integration builds: <br>
   - build 
time is noon Wednesday (Eastern time) <br> - because of the nature 
of the fixes in this stream, these builds should not fail. <br> However, if a 
rebuild is requested by one of the teams, it will take place as soon <br> as the 
build contribution is available. <br> - once a good integration build is achieved, 
it will be marked as such on the website. </p><p>In the above descriptions, a 
build is considered to be a failure if there are &quot;Red X&quot;s that the developers 
agree represent valid reasons for them to not begin using the integration build. 
An example of a Red X which would *not* require a re-build would be a test which 
failed because the test was bogus. </p>
<p>IMPORTANT: This strategy _requires_ 
us to have good build inputs. All teams must use the tools to pre-build and test
   their submissions. In addition, teams should track the nightly builds to detect
  
integration problems early on. What we want to achieve is for the Tuesday morning
   3.2 build to typically be successful, with an infrequent requirement for a
  Wednesday 
morning build. Failing the Wednesday morning rebuild should be treated as a catastrophic
   failure. In other words, more than two or three of these per year is an unacceptable
  
failure rate. </p></td></tr> </table><p>&nbsp;</p></TABLE>
