N builds replace tags specified in org.eclipse.releng map files with HEAD.<br>
I builds use tags org.eclipse.releng map files.
<br>M builds use tags in the R3_3_maintenance
branch of org.eclipse.releng. 
<br>Teams must update map files in time for I and M build start times.<br>
  Performance testing will only occur where indicated.</p>
<p>Times are all EDT (GMT -5)</p>

<h4>Rebuild Policy</h4>
<ul>
<li>Nightly builds - No rebuilds</li>
<li>Integration builds - Same day rebuild if compile errors, missing plugins, the build is unusable or if the drops do not get posted.Otherwise, a rebuild the next day at 8:00am.</li>
<li>Maintenance builds - Rebuild until success</li>
</ul>

<h4>Build Retention Policy</h4>

<tr><td height="19"> <p>In an effort to reduce our disk utilization on the eclipse.org infrastructure and reduce the amount of data sent to the mirrors, we have adopted the following build retention policy.</p>
<li>Release builds are kept indefinitely and moved to the archive.eclipse.org server as appropriate</li>
<li>Four integration and nightly builds are retained</li><li>Maintenance builds are kept until a release of the maintenance stream is available.</li><li>Stable builds are retained until a release is available.</li></li></table>

<h4>Build Notes</h4>

<tr> <td height="19"> 

<strong>For the 3.4 Integration builds: </strong>
<ul>
<li>build time is 8:00 am (Eastern time) on Tuesday mornings.</li> 
<li>In the event of an integration build failure due to compile errors, missing plugins or if the drops are not posted,<br>there will be a same day rebuild upon 
submission of a fix.</li>
<li>Otherwise, there will be a rebuild at noon Wednesday morning to accommodate fixes that have a workaround or do not impact the general usability of the build. 
<li>Teams are expected to indicate on the platform-releng-dev mailing list if they intend to contribute to a rebuild.</li> 
<li> In the event of a double integration build failure, all other work will stop until guaranteed-to-be-successful build contributions are  prepared for a rebuild at 8:00 am Thursday morning.</li> 
<li> if the Thursday 8:00 am (Eastern time) integration build fails we will rebuild until success </li>
<li> once a good integration build is achieved, it will be marked as such on the website.</li> 
<li> the Releng team will often request a go/no go status from all teams to determine if the build is suitable for the week's testing. If you provide status and then 
recontribute to a subsequent build, you are required to revalidate the build and provide an updated status.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<strong>For the 3.3.x maintenance builds: </strong>
<ul>
<li>Build time is 8am Wednesday (Eastern time)</li> 
<li>Due to the nature of the fixes in this stream, these builds should not fail. However, if a 
rebuild is requested by one of the teams, it will take place as soon as the build contribution is available.</li> 

 
<p>In the above descriptions, a build is considered to be a failure if there are &quot;Red X&quot;s that the developers 
agree represent valid reasons for them to not begin using the integration build.  
An example of a Red X which would *not* require a re-build would be a test which 
failed because the test was bogus. </p>

<p>IMPORTANT: This strategy _requires_ 
us to have good build inputs. All teams must use the tools to pre-build and test
   their submissions. In addition, teams should track the nightly builds to detect
integration problems early on. What we want to achieve is for the Tuesday morning
   3.4 build to typically be successful, with an infrequent requirement for a
  Wednesday 
noon build. Failing the Wednesday noon rebuild should be treated as a catastrophic
   failure. In other words, more than two or three of these per year is an unacceptable
  
failure rate. </p>
