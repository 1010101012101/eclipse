Small example which builds the org.eclipse.jdt.core plug-in from the command line using a PDE Build mechanism.

To run the example:

1.  Install eclipse, build 3.1M7 or later

2.  Check out the "scripts" directory from platform-releng-home/examples/build_jdtcore
	i.e. 	cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/eclipse co -d scripts platform-releng-home/examples/build_jdtcore/scripts

3.  To run build:
	-cd to <eclipse install>/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build_3.1.0/scripts
	-execute:
		java -jar <eclipse install>/startup.jar -application org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner -f build.xml -Dbuilder=<absolute path to scripts directory checked out above>

4.  Result from build "a.feature-build.zip" should be located in "scripts/src/I.build"
