<H3>Eclipse Platform Release Engineering FAQ</H3>
<H3>&nbsp;</H3>
<ol start=1>
<li>What hardware comprises the platform-releng build infrastructure?
  <p>The eclipse platform build infrastructure consists of<br>
    2 linux build machines (2GHz, 1GB  and  PowerMac G5, 2GB )<br>
    2 junit test machines, one windows (2GHz, 1 GB) one linux (2.66
    GHz, 1.2 GB )<br>
    4 performance test machines - one set of slower machines (one windows, one
    linux 2GHz, 512 MB) and one set of fast machines (one windows, one linux
    3GHz, 2GB)	
	<br>
	1 linux cvs test server
    (500MHz, 500MB)<br>
    1 database server with apache derby installed to store performance test
  results (2.5GHz, 500MB)
</li><p></p>
<li>Is the Eclipse platform build process completely automated?</li><p></p>


  Yes, the Eclipse
      build process starts with a cron job on our main build machine that initiates
      an shell
      script that checks out the builder projects.<br>
	  
	    org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder -&gt; scripts to build each type
of drop
	    org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder -&gt; a subset of eclipse plugins
          required to run the build.</li>
	    we also use several small cvs projects on an internal server that
          store login credentials, publishing information and jdks


  <p>Fetch, build and assemble scripts are generated automatically the org.eclipse.pde.build
      plugin in org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder. Fetch scripts specify the version
      of code to retreive from the repository. Build
      scripts are also generated automatically to compile all
      java code,
        determine compile order and manage dependancies. Assembly scripts are
      generated to assemble the compiled code into it's final form, tar.gz, zip
      etc. We also
      use custom build scripts that you can see in org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder.</p>
    <p>After the build drops are built, the automated junit and performance testing
    begins. Tests occur over ssh for Linux machines, and rsh for Windows machines.
    Each component team contributes it's own tests. Once the tests are completed,
    the results are copied back to the build machine. Also, the images for the
  performance tests are generated.</p>
  <li>What's the difference between an integration
    and nightly build? 
      </p>
      <p>With
      integration builds, we specify a version of the plugin to retreive in the
    map files. (org.eclipse.releng/maps). With nightly builds, we retrieve
      the plugins specified in the map files from the HEAD stream.      
  </li>
    <p></p>
  <li>I would like to recompile eclipse on a platform that is not currently supported.
    What is the best approach to this? What is the best way to ensure that the
    community can use my work? <p>The best approach is use the source build drop
      and modify the scripts to support  that you are interested in. Then open
      a <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org">bug</a> with product <i>platform</i> and
      component <i>releng</i> attaching the 
	the patches to the scripts that were required to build the new drop.</b> </p>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>How long does the build take to complete?</li>
  <p></p>
  <p>It takes three hours for all the drops to be produced. Junit (five hours)
  and performance tests (eight hours) run in parallel after the drops have been
  built.
  It takes a further 
  two hours for the performance results to be generated. We will reduce the amount
  of time that  the build takes in the 3.2 timeframe by implementing faster hardware
  and more parallel ant tasks.

  <p><li>When is the next build?</li><p>Please refer to the <a href="buildSchedule.html">build
      schedule</a></p><br>
  
  <li>Best releng practices from
    our Eclipsecon </li>
  2005 poster
  </p>
  <p>1. Automate the build process from end-to-end and automate early.<br>
    2. Use PDE Build in Eclipse to generate build scripts.<br>
    3. Automate JUnit testing and performance monitoring.<br>
    4. Automate build notifications (email)<br>
    5. Use gentle humiliation to encourage developers to contribute carefully.
    (Clown nose technique).<br>
    6. Ensure stability in the build process by thorough testing of builder changes.<br>
    7. Schedule builds at regular intervals and enforce rebuild policies.<br>
    8. Use map files in a central cvs repository.<br>
    9. Build on Linux.<br>
    10. Have fun! </p>
