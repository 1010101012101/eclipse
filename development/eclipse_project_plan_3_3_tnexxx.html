<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely static. To ensure 
  the planning process is transparent and open to the entire Eclipse community, 
  we (the Eclipse Project PMC) post plans in an embryonic form and revise them 
  throughout the release cycle. 
</p>
<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of release
  deliverables, release milestones, target operating environments, and
  release-to-release compatibility. These are all things that need to be clear for
  any release, even if no features were to change.
</p>
<p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for all of the sub-projects under 
  the top level Eclipse Project. Each plan item covers a feature or API 
  that is to be added to the Eclipse Project deliverables, or some aspect of the Eclipse Project 
  that is to be improved. Each plan item has its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla 
  database, with a title and a concise summary (usually a single paragraph) that 
  explains the work item at a suitably high enough level so that everyone can 
  readily understand what the work item is without having to understand the nitty-gritty 
  detail. 
</p>
<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite
  large, others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that is localized
  to a single component; others may involve coordinated changes to
  several components; other may pervade the entire SDK. Although some plan
  items are for work that is more pressing than others, the plan items appear in
  no particular order.
</p>
<p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan for how we
  will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs, improving test coverage,
  documentation, examples, performance tuning, usability, etc. are considered routine
  ongoing maintenance activities and are not included in this plan unless they
  would also involve a significant change to the API or feature set, or involve a
  significant amount of work. The intent of the plan is to account for all interesting feature work.
</p>
<p>The current status of each plan item is noted:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we have
    decided to address for the release.</li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are
    considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
    investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say
    that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a proposal
    will either be committed or deferred.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
    to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note as
    to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed plan
    items at a later point.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Deliverables"></a>Release deliverables</h2>

<p>The release deliverables have the same form as previous releases, namely:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Source code release for all Eclipse Project deliverables, available as versions 
    tagged "R3_3" in the Eclipse Project <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/">CVS 
    repository</a>.</li>
  <li>Eclipse SDK (runtime binary and SDK for Equinox, Platform, JDT, and PDE) (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse Platform (runtime binary and SDK for the Equinox and Platform only) (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse RCP (runtime binary and SDK for the Rich Client Platform) (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse JDT (runtime binary and SDK for the Java Development Tools) (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse PDE (runtime binary and SDK for the Plug-in Development Environment) (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse SDK Examples (downloadable).</li>
  <li>SWT distribution (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Equinox OSGi R4 framework and assorted service implementations (downloadable).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Milestones"></a>Release milestones</h2>

<p>Release milestones, occurring at roughly 6 week intervals, exist to facilitate 
  coarse-grained planning and staging. The milestones are:

</ul>
<p>Our target is to complete 3.3 in late June 2007. All release deliverables will be available
  for download as soon as the release has been tested and validated in the target operating
  configurations listed below.
</p>

<h2><a name="TargetOperatingEnvironments"></a>Target Operating Environments</h2>

<p>In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably current
  operating environments.
</p>
<p>Most of the Eclipse SDK is "pure" Java code and has no direct
  dependence on the underlying operating system. The chief dependence is
  therefore on the Java Platform itself. Portions of the Eclipse SDK
  (including the RCP base, SWT, OSGi and JDT core plug-ins) are targeted
  to specific classes of operating environments, requiring their source
  code to only reference facilities available in particular class
  libraries (e.g. J2ME Foundation 1.0, J2SE 1.3 and 1.4, etc.).
 </p><p> 
  <img src="new.gif" alt="(new)" border="0" height="12" width="12">
  In general, the 3.3 release of the Eclipse Project is developed on a
  mix of Java 1.4 and Java5 VMs. As such, the Eclipse Project SDK as
  a whole is targeted at both 1.4 and Java5 VMs, with full functionality 
  available for 1.4 level development everywhere, and new Java5 specific
  capabilities available when running on a Java5 VM. Similarly, in cases
  where support has been added for Java6 specific features (e.g. JSR-199,
  JSR-269, etc.) Java6 VMs are required.
</p><p>
  <a href="#Appendix1">Appendix 1</a> contains a table that indicates
  the class library level required for each plug-in.
</p>

<p>There are many different implementations of the Java Platform running atop 
  a variety of operating systems. We focus Eclipse SDK testing on a handful 
  of popular combinations of operating system and Java Platform; 
  these are our <em>reference platforms</em>. Eclipse undoubtedly runs fine in 
  many operating environments beyond the reference platforms we test, including
  those using Java6 VMs. However, since we do not systematically test them we
  cannot vouch for them. Problems encountered when running Eclipse on a non-reference
  platform that cannot be recreated on any reference platform will be given lower
  priority than problems with running Eclipse on a reference platform.</p>
  
<p>The Eclipse SDK 3.3 is tested and validated on the following reference 
  platforms (this list is updated over the course of the release cycle):<br />

<dt><em>Caveat: Using IBM 32-bit SDK for Windows, Java 2 Technology Edition 5.0, SR4 on Vista</em></dt>
<dd>Although we expect this to be fixed in IBM Java5 SR5, there is currently a conflict between
the use of DirectDraw by the <strong>AWT</strong> libraries in IBM Java5 SR4 and
the Windows Vista "Aero" theme. Although the Eclipse SDK itself does not use these libraries
(and thus runs well on Windows Vista using that VM), other plug-ins that make use of the 
conflicting AWT capabilities may cause the advanced features of Aero to be disabled. As a
workaround to avoid this problem, you can add <code>-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true</code> to the
VM arguments when launching Eclipse, which will prevent the AWT libraries from using DirectDraw. 
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Because Java 1.4.2 and Java5 based platforms are used for most Eclipse
  development, those platforms are listed here. Although there are teams
  doing some Java 6 based development we have not included specific Java6 VMs,
  since they have not yet received the general level of testing we require.
  <i>We expect that Eclipse will work fine on other current Java VMs
  running on window systems supported by SWT, but can not flag these as reference
  platforms without significant community support for testing them.</i></p>
  
<p>Similarly, although untested, the Eclipse SDK should work fine on other OSes that 
  support the same window system. For Win32: NT, 2000, and Server 
  2003; SWT HTML viewer requires Internet Explorer 5 (or higher). For GTK on other 
  Linux systems: version 2.2.1 of the GTK+ widget toolkit and associated libraries 
  (GLib, Pango); SWT HTML viewer requires Mozilla 1.4GTK2. For Motif on 
  Linux systems: Open Motif 2.1 (included); SWT HTML viewer requires Mozilla 1.4GTK2.</p>

<p>SWT is also supported on the QNX Neutrino operating system, x86 processor, 
  Photon window system, and IBM J9 VM version 2.0. Eclipse 3.3 on Windows or Linux 
  can be used to cross-develop QNX applications. (Eclipse 3.3 is unavailable on QNX 
  because there is currently no 1.5 J2SE for QNX.)</p>
  
<h4>Internationalization</h4>

<p>The Eclipse SDK is designed as the basis for internationalized products. 
  The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, including 
  dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided 
  as the default resource bundles.</p>
  
<p>Latin-1 locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on all of the above 
  operating environments; DBCS locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK 
  on the Windows, GTK, and Motif window systems; BIDI locales are supported by 
  the Eclipse SDK only on Windows operating environments.</p>

<p>The Eclipse SDK supports GB 18030 (level 1), the Chinese code page 
  standard, on Windows XP and 2000, and Linux/GTK.</p>

<p>German and Japanese locales are tested.</p>

<h4>BIDI support</h4>

<p>SWT fully supports BIDI on Windows. On Linux GTK, SWT supports entering 
  and displaying BIDI text. Within these limitations, the Eclipse
  SDK tools are BIDI enabled.</p>
  
<h2><a name="Compatibility"></a>Compatibility with Previous Releases</h2>

<h3>Compatibility of Release 3.3 with 3.2</h3>

<p>Eclipse 3.3 will be compatible with Eclipse 3.2 (and, hence, with 3.1 and 3.0).</p>
<p>
  <strong>API Contract Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 3.3 will be upwards contract-compatible 
  with Eclipse SDK 3.2 except in those areas noted in the 
  <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_3_porting_guide.html" target="_top">
    <em>Eclipse 3.3 Plug-in Migration Guide</em>
  </a>. 
  Programs that use affected APIs and extension points will need to be ported to
  Eclipse SDK 3.3 APIs. Downward contract compatibility is not supported.
  There is no guarantee that compliance with Eclipse SDK 3.3 
  APIs would ensure compliance with Eclipse SDK 3.2 APIs. Refer to 
  <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Evolving_Java-based_APIs">
    <em>Evolving Java-based APIs</em>
  </a> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain 
  contract compatibility.
</p>
<p><strong>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 3.3 will be upwards binary-compatible 
  with Eclipse SDK 3.2 except in those areas noted in the
  <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_3_porting_guide.html" target="_top">
    <em>Eclipse 3.3 Plug-in Migration Guide</em>
  </a>. 
  Downward plug-in compatibility is not supported. Plug-ins for Eclipse SDK 3.3
  will not be usable in Eclipse SDK 3.2. Refer to
  <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Evolving_Java-based_APIs">
    <em>Evolving Java-based APIs</em>
  </a> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain 
  binary compatibility. 
</p>
<p><strong>Source Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 3.3 will be upwards source-compatible 
  with Eclipse SDK 3.2 except in the areas noted in the 
  <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_3_porting_guide.html" target="_top">
    <em>Eclipse 3.3 Plug-in Migration Guide</em>
  </a>. 
  This means that source files written to 
  use Eclipse SDK 3.2 APIs might successfully compile and run against Eclipse 
  SDK 3.3 APIs, although this is not guaranteed. Downward source compatibility 
  is not supported. If source files use new Eclipse SDK APIs, they will not be 
  usable with an earlier version of the Eclipse SDK. 
</p>
<p><strong>Workspace Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 3.3 will be upwards workspace-compatible 
  with Eclipse SDK 3.2 unless noted. This means that workspaces and projects created 
  with Eclipse SDK 3.2, 3.1 or 3.0 can be successfully opened by Eclipse SDK 3.3 and 
  upgraded to a 3.3 workspace. This includes both hidden metadata, which is localized 
  to a particular workspace, as well as metadata files found within a workspace 
  project (e.g., the .project file), which may propagate between workspaces via 
  file copying or team repositories. Individual plug-ins developed for Eclipse 
  SDK 3.3 should provide similar upwards compatibility for their hidden and visible 
  workspace metadata created by earlier versions; 3.3 plug-in developers are responsible 
  for ensuring that their plug-ins recognize 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 2.1, and 2.0 metadata and 
  process it appropriately. User interface session state may be discarded when 
  a workspace is upgraded. Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. 
  A workspace created (or opened) by a product based on Eclipse 3.3 will be unusable 
  with a product based an earlier version of Eclipse. Visible metadata files created 
  (or overwritten) by Eclipse 3.3 will generally be unusable with earlier versions 
  of Eclipse. 
</p>
<p><strong>Non-compliant usage of API's</strong>: All non-API methods and classes, and
  certainly everything in a package with "internal" in its name, are
  considered implementation details which may vary between operating environment
  and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend
  on anything other than what is specified in the Eclipse SDK API are inherently
  unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single
  release much less with earlier releases. Refer to
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">
    <em>How to Use the Eclipse API</em>
  </a> for information about how to write compliant plug-ins.
</p>

<h2>Themes and Priorities</h2>
<p>
  The PMC of the Eclipse Project has identified six major areas of work, 
  that will be the priorities for this development cycle. These areas will
  address the major themes identified by the Eclipse Requirements Council 
  (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/councils/roadmap_v2_0/themes_v2_0.php">Themes and Priorities v2.0</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Although there are four projects under the top-level Eclipse Project, there
  is a significant amount of commonality and shared effort between them. 
  In general, many plan items involve coordinated changes to multiple
  components, and thus attempting to separate the items into
  sections based on sub-project leads to artificial distinctions between
  them (e.g. Platform Text vs. JDT Text, Platform Debug vs.
  JDT Debug, etc.).
</p>
<p>
  In order to provide the clearest focus for our development effort, we
  have organized the items below into sections based on the work area they
  are intended to address. Items that apply to multiple
  work areas are categorized based on where the most effort is expected
  to occur. In all cases, the items listed reflect new features of Eclipse
  or areas where existing features will be significantly reworked. Numbers in
  parentheses link to bugzilla problem reports where progress on that 
  item can be tracked and discussed.

<h2><a name="Components">Components</a></h2>

  This work will enhance Eclipse's use of, and support for, software components,
  covering everything from component programming models such as Declarative
  Services, API tools, incremental building and fine-grained function delivery.

<h4>Committed Items (Components)</h4>
<blockquote> 

<p>(<img src="new.gif" alt="(new)" border="0" height="12" width="12"> committed)
    <strong>Bundle/Module Development Tools.</strong>
    In 3.1 and 3.2 PDE made gigantic strides in support for
    traditional OSGi bundle development. Even still, in 3.3. we will improve
    various workflows and classpath management strategies to promote the
    development of robust and independent right-grained components. This
    covers everything from increased quick-fix and manifest editing support
    to deeper integration with JDT (e.g., support for searching JARs that
    are not in the workspace without implicitly importing the JARs). In
    addition, as JSR 291 evolves in the Java SE 6 time frame, PDE will be
    there to provide developer support. 3.3 will include tooling around OSGi
    Declarative Services and the new application model as well as improved
    support for launching other frameworks, Java applications with bundle
    based classpaths and "hot launching" frameworks.

    <strong>Target Provisioning.</strong>
    Currently, users wanting additional function supplied by others must
    manually acquire and install these additional bundles in their target
    platform.  This process is tiresome and error-prone.  As an extension
    to the proposed provisioning work, we will add the ability to provision
    targets directly from bundle repositories as well as from other locations
    on the local machine.  As part of this the mechanism by which source is
    packaged, acquired and looked up will be reviewed and streamlined.

    <strong>Application Model.</strong>
    The OSGi R4 MEG specification includes an application model that significantly
    decouples the application from the rest of the system.  The net result is OSGi
    (and thus Eclipse) as a more flexible application container, for example allowing
    multiple applications to run concurrently and improved lifecycle around the
    application.  These characteristics are important both to the manageability of
    the system (e.g., simplifying and clarifying the shutdown process) but also to
    various RCP scenarios such as Kiosk-mode and Application Container models.
    In 3.3 we will implement and adopt the MEG application model.

    <strong>OSGi R4.1 Specification Work.</strong>
    Much of the success Eclipse has enjoyed with OSGi comes from the fact that the
    Eclipse community has played a very active role in the evolution of various
    OSGi specifications.  With increased interest in OSGi and Java modularity
    (see JSR 277, JSR 291 and JSR 232) this participation has never been more important.
    In addition to promoting Eclipse use-cases and the evolution of these standards
    to benefit Eclipse, there are a number of gaps in the OSGi specifications that
    Eclipse is currently filling in specific ways and should be addressed in R4.1.
    For example the management of API in metadata (x-friends and x-internal),
    integration techniques for third party and legacy code, in-place execution of
    bundles, basic notions of data location, etc.  The Equinox team will continue
    their active participation in these specification processes and keep Eclipse
    on the leading edge of Java componentization.
    <em>(<img src="new.gif" alt="(new)" border="0" height="12" width="12">
    Note that originally this plan item targeted R5 but the next version of the
    spec is going to be R4.1 so we have updated this item accordingly.)</em>

    <strong>Server side support.</strong>
    First it was tools, then it was applications, now server-side programmers are
    waking up to the power of componentization delivered by Eclipse and OSGi.
    In the 3.2 cycle an Equinox incubator was started to investigate the use of
    Eclipse on the server.  It started as a very modest servlet bridge allowing
    Eclipse to run inside a servlet engine and handle servlet requests and has been
    evolving into a full-blown appreciation of what it means to componentize server
    software.  There are many possible directions here and there is no way the
    Equinox team proper will be able to track, support and participate in all.

    Currently it is not possible to write all your help content in your own
    format, and have it converted into HTML, TOC, keyword index, and context
    help on-the-fly. For the table of contents you must supply the information
    in the toc XML format, you cannot use any other format or write code to

<h4>Proposed Items (Components)</h4>

<p><strong>Improved support for provisioning.</strong>
    Eclipse has advanced quite quickly with new use-cases (RCP, Equinox, 
    server side, etc.) and new technologies (e.g., OSGi and OSGi's MEG) coming
    into the picture.  To date Update Manager has not been enhanced to support
    or exploit these changes. In 3.3 we will investigate provisioning support
    for enhanced workflows, the ability to update the so-called "root files"
    (e.g., startup.jar, eclipse.exe), improved efficiency (download and disk
    footprint), support for right-grained discovery and acquisition of function
    as well as integration with differing repository types. This effort also
    includes enhancements to the tooling around provisioning.

<p><strong>Bundle Management.</strong>
    Managing even modest systems of bundles can be complex and error prone.  There are 
    several places in PDE where developers need to list or select sets of bundles (e.g.,
    launch configurations, target setup, etc).  In many cases the environment already
    includes relevant grouping constructs (e.g., features, working sets, bundle groups).
    PDE should surface these to developers in a clear, consistent and pervasive 
    fashion.

    <strong>API tools.</strong>
    More components means more API and an elevated need for solid APIs,
    evolved but compatible APIs and the correct and understood use of APIs.
    This cannot be achieved without supporting tooling.  Today PDE includes
    sophisticated support for classpath management and access rule management
    based on information in the manifest of bundles to facilitate the capture
    of package and class references.  In 3.3. we will expand this to cover
    finer-grained API contracts (e.g., clients should not call foo() or
    extend Bar).  Similarly, developers will be given effective mechanisms
    for discovering, visualizing and minimizing dependencies in their code, 
    bundles produced by third parties and non-bundled code libraries.  Tooling in support
    of checking and managing the evolution of component and package version numbers
    will also be supplied.

    <strong>Incremental Plug-in Build.</strong>
    With the increase in plug-ins coming from and going to third parties the
    development cycle needs to be more incremental.  In the Eclipse project
    itself we have started to consume pre-built plugins such as ICU4J and SSH2.
    This trend is likely to continue as, for example, Apache seeks to deliver
    their libraries as bundles and more people look to consume individual
    bundles/components from Equinox and similar projects.  As such, the build
    process should support the incremental building of plug-ins (that is
    building plugins individually) based on a set of pre-built plugins kept
    in some sort of provisioning repository.  Plug-ins coming out of the build
    should feed into said repository to be used as a base for future builds.
    This ability will in turn enable the more frequent building of whole
    systems (since you build only what has changed) and simplify incremental,
    milestone and release build cycles.

   <strong>Improve serviceability.</strong>
   When an end user encounters a problem with Eclipse, it is important for
   support teams to be able to diagnose the root cause of the failure, and
   identify the failing plug-in. Eclipse should have enhanced error reporting
   tools that make it easy for end users to report problems. Tools should be
   available at all times, so that knowledgeable users can diagnose
   unexpected behavior such as slow-downs or exceptional memory use. Error
   handling is done in a variety of ways within the platform which are not
   extensible to RCP applications. An improved story would allow for the
   inclusion of application defined error support (such as a link to a support centre 
   for the product) and remote monitoring/inspection of system health and would 
   tie the current error reporting story together into a solution with a more 
   consistent look and fewer error reporting paths for developers.

    up with additional, sometimes quite divergent requirements. We will

    as refine plug-in dependency declarations.

    workbench cheat sheet view.

<h2><a name="API">API</a></h2>
<p>
  This work area deals specifically with issues concerning the application
  programming interfaces provided by the Eclipse Project. We will identify
  API whose function has been superceded, and ensure that the SDK does
  not depend on this API. We will encourage adoption within the SDK of
  some of the more recent additions to Eclipse, such as
  the command framework, Equinox preferences, tabbed
  properties and the common navigator. We will work with the community to
  ensure that needed functionality is made available as API, when it reaches
  appropriate levels of maturity.

    <strong>Generalize editor annotation and ruler support.</strong>
    We should allow plug-ins to contribute additional vertical rulers
    to show additional information (e.g. code coverage). We should
    support live annotate "color by age" in addition to "color by
    contributor".

    <strong>Adopt the new UI features.</strong>
    We should adopt the following items across the entire SDK UI: the new
    command framework, preference initializers, field assist, SWT column
    sort indicators, working sets, tabbed properties view and the common navigator.

    <strong>Provide access to more native controls.</strong>
    We should provide access to more of the native controls that are available
    on each platform, such as date and time pickers, and table header widgets. 
    In addition, we should enable more features of existing native controls,
    such as table wrapping on Windows.

    <strong>Custom widget API support.</strong>
    Investigate ways to simplify the process of writing custom widgets,
    including making available, as API, some of the currently internal
    capabilities of the custom widgets implemented in the SDK, such as
    drag under feedback for drag & drop.

    <strong>Finish re-work of commands and key bindings.</strong>
    In 3.2, we built some important infrastructure that will allows us to
    rationalize our commands and key bindings story. We need to complete this
    effort, making sure the new story supports all of the existing
    functionality (e.g action sets), and migrate over to the new support.
    We also need to make it easier to add and edit key bindings.

    <strong>JFace data binding.</strong>
    In 3.2, we developed a data binding framework for JFace but did not
    make it generally available. We should continue to work towards providing a 
    public API for this framework and investigate how it will be delivered and
    used within the SDK.

    <strong>Improve compare.</strong>
    The Compare plugin has not undergone much work in the last few releases
    and is showing it. From an architectural standpoint, there are several
    Compare internals that need to be made API in order to properly support
    clients and there are also several polish items that have been identified
    by Eclipse development teams. In addition, new ISaveable support was added
    in 3.2 and we should investigate integrating this into Compare. From a
    usability standpoint, the compare editor uses a custom viewer for content
    which appears similar to the related editor but has a reduced capability
    which is often confusing for users. Smaller usability issues involve
    breaking out the outline from the editor into the Outline view. There is
    supported by compare but is not used by Team or other Platform clients.

    <strong>Graphics Improvements.</strong>
    The SWT graphics layer should provide support for fractional line widths,
    dashes and fonts, the ability to flatten paths, image loading/saving
    improvements, and other similar enhancements.

<h4>Proposed Items (API)</h4>
<blockquote> 

<p><strong>Adopt the Eclipse File System.</strong>
    We should ensure that use of the Eclipse File System is pervasive
    in the platform, and remove any barriers that prevent it from being
    more widely adopted by the community. For example, we should provide
    IFileStoreEditorInput and a matching default implementation.

    <strong>APIs for custom debugger integration.</strong>
    Publish public APIs based on the provisional APIs introduced in 3.2 to
    support custom debugger integration. Features include flexible hierarchy
    in debug views; asynchronous, cancellable interactions when retrieving
    content and labels; model-driven view updates; a debug context service
    for retargettable actions, flexible view wiring and pluggable source
    lookup.
