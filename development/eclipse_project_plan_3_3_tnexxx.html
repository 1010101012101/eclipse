<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the next feature release

<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely static. To ensure 
  the planning process is transparent and open to the entire Eclipse community, 
  we (the Eclipse Project PMC) post plans in an embryonic form and revise them 
  throughout the release cycle. 
</p>
<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of release
  deliverables, release milestones, target operating environments, and
  release-to-release compatibility. These are all things that need to be clear for
  any release, even if no features were to change.
</p>
<p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the four projects under 
  the top level Eclipse Project. Each plan item covers a feature or API 
  that is to be added to the Eclipse Project deliverables, or some aspect of the Eclipse Project 
  that is to be improved. Each plan item has its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla 
  database, with a title and a concise summary (usually a single paragraph) that 
  explains the work item at a suitably high enough level so that everyone can 
  readily understand what the work item is without having to understand the nitty-gritty 
  detail. 
</p>
<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite
  large, others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that is localized
  to a single component; others may involve coordinated changes to
  several components; other may pervade the entire SDK. Although some plan
  items are for work that is more pressing than others, the plan items appear in
  no particular order.
</p>
<p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan for how we
  will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs, improving test coverage,
  documentation, examples, performance tuning, usability, etc. are considered routine
  ongoing maintenance activities and are not included in this plan unless they
  would also involve a significant change to the API or feature set, or involve a
  significant amount of work. The intent of the plan is to account for all interesting feature work.
</p>
<p>The current status of each plan item is noted:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we have
    decided to address for the release.</li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are
    considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
    investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say
    that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a proposal
    will either be committed or deferred.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
    to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note as
    to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed plan
    items at a later point.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Deliverables"></a>Release deliverables</h2>

<p>The release deliverables have the same form as previous releases, namely:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Source code release for all Eclipse Project deliverables, available as versions 
    tagged "R3_2" in the Eclipse Project <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/">CVS 
    repository</a>.</li>
  <li>Eclipse SDK (runtime binary and SDK for Platform, JDT, and PDE) (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse Platform (runtime binary and SDK for the Platform only) (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse RCP (runtime binary and SDK for the Rich Client Platform) (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse JDT (runtime binary and SDK for the Java Development Tools) (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse PDE (runtime binary and SDK for the Plug-in Development Environment) (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse SDK Examples (downloadable).</li>
  <li>SWT distribution (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Equinox OSGi R4 framework and assorted service implementations (downloadable).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Milestones"></a>Release milestones</h2>

<p>Release milestones, occurring at roughly 6 week intervals, exist to facilitate 
  coarse-grained planning and staging. The milestones are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Friday Aug. 12, 2005 - Milestone 1 (3.2 M1) - stable build</li>
  <li> Friday Sep. 23, 2005 - Milestone 2 (3.2 M2) - stable build</li>
  <li> Friday Nov. 4, 2005 - Milestone 3 (3.2 M3) - stable build</li>
  <li> Friday Dec. 16, 2005 - Milestone 4 (3.2 M4) - stable build</li>
  <li> Friday Feb. 17, 2006 - Milestone 5 (3.2 M5) - stable build - API complete - API freeze</li>
  <li> Friday Mar. 31, 2006 - Milestone 6 (3.2 M6) - stable build - feature complete - development 
    freeze - lock down and testing begins</li>
</ul>
<p>Our target is to complete 3.2 in late June 2006. All release deliverables will be available
  for download as soon as the release has been tested and validated in the target operating
  configurations listed below.
</p>

<h2><a name="TargetOperatingEnvironments"></a>Target Operating Environments</h2>

<p>In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably current
  operating environments.
</p>
<p>Most of the Eclipse SDK is "pure" Java code and has no direct
  dependence on the underlying operating system. The chief dependence is
  therefore on the Java Platform itself. Portions of the Eclipse SDK
  (including the RCP base, SWT, OSGi and JDT core plug-ins) are targeted
  to specific classes of operating environments, requiring their source
  code to only reference facilities available in particular class
  libraries (e.g. J2ME Foundation 1.0, J2SE 1.3 and 1.4, etc.).
  
  <img src="new.gif" alt="(new)" border="0" height="12" width="12">
  With the exception of a small set of planned features that
  actually require Java SE 5 APIs (most notably, the support for
  Annotation Processing and JUnit 4), the 3.2 release of the Eclipse
  Project is developed against version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform.
  As such, the Eclipse Project SDK as a whole is targeted at both
  1.4 and Java5 VMs, with full functionality available for 1.4 level
  development everywhere, and new Java5 specific capabilities available
  when running on a Java5 VM.

  <a href="#Appendix1">Appendix 1</a> contains a table that indicates
  the class library level required for each plug-in.
</p>

<p>There are many different implementations of the Java Platform running atop 
  a variety of operating systems. We focus Eclipse SDK testing on a handful 
  of popular <span class="header">combinations of operating system and Java Platform; 
  these are our <em>reference platforms</em>. Eclipse undoubtedly runs fine in 
  many operating environments beyond the reference platforms we test. However, 
  since we do not systematically test them we cannot vouch for them. Problems 
  encountered when running Eclipse on a non-reference platform that cannot be recreated 
  on any reference platform will be given lower priority than problems with running 
  Eclipse on a reference platform.</span></p>
<p>The Eclipse SDK 3.2 is tested and validated on the following reference 
  platforms (this list is updated over the course of the release cycle):</p>

<p>Because Java 1.4.2 platforms are used for most Eclipse development,
  in general, 1.4.2 platforms are listed here. Of course, the teams doing Java 5 based
  development are using Java 5 platforms, and the specific ones that they test on
  are also included. <i>We expect that Eclipse will work fine on other Java 5 VMs
  running on window systems supported by SWT, but can not flag these as reference
  platforms without significant community support for testing them.</i></p>
  
<p>Similarly, although untested, the Eclipse SDK should work fine on other OSes that 
  support the same window system. For Win32: Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, and Server 
  2003; SWT HTML viewer requires Internet Explorer 5 (or higher). For GTK on other 
  Linux systems: version 2.2.1 of the GTK+ widget toolkit and associated libraries 
  (GLib, Pango); SWT HTML viewer requires Mozilla 1.4GTK2. For Motif on 
  Linux systems: Open Motif 2.1 (included); SWT HTML viewer requires Mozilla 1.4GTK2.</p>

<p>An early access version of the Eclipse SDK is also available for 64-bit 
  Linux GTK. Testing has been limited to early access 64-bit J2SEs running on 
  x86-64 processors.</p>
  
<p>SWT is also supported on the QNX Neutrino operating system, x86 processor, 
  Photon window system, and IBM J9 VM version 2.0. Eclipse 3.2 on Windows or Linux 
  can be used to cross-develop QNX applications. (Eclipse 3.2 is unavailable on QNX 
  because there is currently no 1.5 J2SE for QNX.)</p>
  
<h4>Internationalization</h4>

<p>The Eclipse SDK is designed as the basis for internationalized products. 
  The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, including 
  dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided 
  as the default resource bundles.</p>
  
<p>Latin-1 locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on all of the above 
  operating environments; DBCS locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK 
  on the Windows, GTK, and Motif window systems; BIDI locales are supported by 
  the Eclipse SDK only on Windows operating environments.</p>

<p>The Eclipse SDK supports GB 18030 (level 1), the Chinese code page 
  standard, on Windows XP and 2000, and Linux/GTK.</p>

<p>German and Japanese locales are tested.</p>

<h4>BIDI support</h4>

<p>SWT fully supports BIDI on Windows. On Linux GTK, SWT supports entering 
  and displaying BIDI text. Within these limitations, the Eclipse
  SDK tools are BIDI enabled.</p>
  
<h2><a name="Compatibility"></a>Compatibility with Previous Releases</h2>

<h3>Compatibility of Release 3.2 with 3.1</h3>

<p>Eclipse 3.2 will be compatible with Eclipse 3.1 (and, hence, with 3.0).</p>
<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.2 will be upwards contract-compatible 
  with Eclipse SDK 3.1 except in those areas noted in the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_2_porting_guide.html" target="_top"><em>Eclipse 
  3.2 Plug-in Migration Guide</em></a>. Programs that use affected APIs and extension 
  points will need to be ported to Eclipse SDK 3.2 APIs. Downward contract compatibility 
  is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with Eclipse SDK 3.2 
  APIs would ensure compliance with Eclipse SDK 3.1 APIs. Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving 
  Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain 
  contract compatibility.</p>
<p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.2 will be upwards binary-compatible 
  with Eclipse SDK 3.1 except in those areas noted in the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_2_porting_guide.html" target="_top"><em>Eclipse 
  3.2 Plug-in Migration Guide</em></a>. Downward plug-in compatibility is not 
  supported. Plug-ins for Eclipse SDK 3.2 will not be usable in Eclipse SDK 3.1. 
  Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving 
  Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain 
  binary compatibility. 
</p><p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.2 will be upwards source-compatible 
  with Eclipse SDK 3.1 except in the areas noted in the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_2_porting_guide.html" target="_top"><em>Eclipse 
  3.2 Plug-in Migration Guide</em></a>. This means that source files written to 
  use Eclipse SDK 3.1 APIs might successfully compile and run against Eclipse 
  SDK 3.2 APIs, although this is not guaranteed. Downward source compatibility 
  is not supported. If source files use new Eclipse SDK APIs, they will not be 
  usable with an earlier version of the Eclipse SDK. 
</p><p><b>Workspace Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.2 will be upwards workspace-compatible 
  with Eclipse SDK 3.1 unless noted. This means that workspaces and projects created 
  with Eclipse SDK 3.1 or 3.0 can be successfully opened by Eclipse SDK 3.2 and 
  upgraded to a 3.2 workspace. This includes both hidden metadata, which is localized 
  to a particular workspace, as well as metadata files found within a workspace 
  project (e.g., the .project file), which may propagate between workspaces via 
  file copying or team repositories. Individual plug-ins developed for Eclipse 
  SDK 3.2 should provide similar upwards compatibility for their hidden and visible 
  workspace metadata created by earlier versions; 3.2 plug-in developers are responsible 
  for ensuring that their plug-ins recognize 3.1, 3.0, 2.1, and 2.0 metadata and 
  process it appropriately. User interface session state may be discarded when 
  a workspace is upgraded. Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. 
  A workspace created (or opened) by a product based on Eclipse 3.2 will be unusable 
  with a product based an earlier version of Eclipse. Visible metadata files created 
  (or overwritten) by Eclipse 3.2 will generally be unusable with earlier versions 
  of Eclipse. 
</p><p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and
certainly everything in a package with "internal" in its name, are
considered implementation details which may vary between operating environment
and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend
on anything other than what is specified in the Eclipse SDK API are inherently
unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single
release much less with earlier releases. Refer to <i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How
to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write compliant
plug-ins.
</p><h2>Themes and Priorities</h2>
<p>The changes under consideration for the next release of Eclipse
Platform, JDT, PDE and Equinox will address major themes identified by
the Eclipse Requirements Council (Themes and Priorities dated Dec. 15,
2004 - <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/councils/20041215EclipseTPFinalDraft.pdf">pdf)</a>. 
  The following are especially germane to this top level project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scaling Up</strong> - This refers to the need for Eclipse to deal 
    with development and deployment on a larger and more complex scale. Increasing 
    complexities arise from large development teams distributed in different locations, 
    large source code bases and fragile build environments that have been developed 
    incrementally over time, the dynamic nature of new source code bases and their 
    interaction with configuration management, and build environments involving 
    many different tools and build rules.</li>
  <li><strong>Enterprise Ready</strong> - Eclipse should be improved to allow 
    it to be better used by large development organizations.</li>
  <li><strong>Design for Extensibility: Be a Better Platform</strong> - Within 
    the Eclipse community, many development projects are defining new development 
    platforms on top of the Eclipse Project deliverables. These must evolve 
    to better support this type of usage, including providing new common infrastructure 
    and abstraction layers needed by upper platforms and adding APIs to expose 
    existing functionality only available internally so that upper platforms can 
    more readily integrate with and reuse what's already there.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple to Use</strong> - 
	The Eclipse components need to not only provide the features that advanced users demand,
	but also be something that most users find simple to use.</li>
  <li><strong>Rich Client Platform</strong> - 
	The Eclipse RCP is a Java-based application framework for the desktop. Building on the
	Eclipse runtime and the modular plug-in story, it is possible to build applications ranging from
	command line tools to feature-rich applications that take full advantage of SWT's native
	platform integration and the many other reusable components.</li>
  <li><strong>Appealing to the Broader Community</strong> - 
	This theme includes work that grows deeper roots into the various OS-specific communities,
	spreads Eclipse to additional operating environments, virtual machines, application
	development and deployment lifecycles, vertical market-specific frameworks and builds
	bridges to other open source communities.</li>

    <strong>Re-think the Import/Export mechanism.</strong>
    The current import/export dialogs include numerous capabilities that
    users do not expect to see. We need to distinguish between mechanisms
    for sharing state (such as Preferences) versus actual format converting
    operations, which are what import/export is traditionally used for. We
    should also investigate data synchronization as an alternative.

    <strong>Ship Finer-grained Components</strong>
    The Eclipse project produces three major outputs, the Platform, JDT and PDE.
    These are exposed as zips on download sites and features on update sites.
    Users wanting to get just part of one of these components (e.g., Help,
    Update, JDT Core) must first discover which zip or feature contains the
    desired function, acquire that container and finally identify and extract
    the desired/needed plugins.  To make this easier we will revise the
    feature/grouping structure to capture more independent and re-usable components.

    <strong>Improved support for provisioning</strong>
    Update Manager has evolved quite slowly while the world around it has
    advanced quite quickly. New usecases (RCP, Equinox, server side, ...) and
    technlogies (e.g., OSGi) have come to play in Eclipse but Update Manager
    has not been enhanced to support or exploit these changes.  In 3.3 we
    will undertake a significant effort to rework the Eclipse Update Manager
    support to enhance workflows, efficiencies (download and disk footprint),
    support fine-grained discovery and acquisition of function and facilitate
    integration with a wide range of repositories.

    <strong>Complete Update Support</strong>
    Most but not all of Eclipse is updateable.  The so-called "root files"
    (e.g., startup.jar, eclipse.exe) typically cannot be updated in a reasonable
    fashion.  In 3.3. we will make all aspects of Eclipse updatable.  Gone will
    be the days of not being able to update from one release to the next.

    <strong>Target provisioning</strong>
    Currently, users wanting to use additional function supplied by others must
    manually acquire and install these additional bundles in their target
    platform.  This process is tiresome and error-prone.  As an extension
    to the proposed provisioning work, we will add the ability to provision
    targets directly from bundle repositories as well as from other locations
    on the local machine.  As part of this the mechanism by which source is
    packaged, acquired and looked up will be reviewed and streamlined.

    <strong>Incremental Plug-in Build</strong>
    With the increase in plug-ins coming from and going to third parties the
    development cycle needs to be more incremental.  In the Eclipse project
    itself we have started to consume prebuilt plugins such as ICU4J and SSH2.
    This trend is likely to continue as, for example, Apache seeks to deliver
    their libraries as bundles and more people look to consume individual
    bundles/components from Equinox and similar projects.  As such, the build
    process should support the incremental building of plug-ins (that is
    building plugins individually) based on a set of pre-built plugins kept
    in some sort of provisioning repository.  Plug-ins coming out of the build
    should feed into said repository to be used as a base for future builds.
    This ability will in turn enable the more frequent building of whole
    systems (since you build only what has changed) and simplify incremental,
    milestone and release build cycles.

    <strong>API tools</strong>
    More components means more API and an elevated need for solid APIs,
    evolved but compatible APIs and the correct and understood use of APIs.
    This cannot be achieved without supporting tooling.  Today PDE includes
    sophisticated support for classpath management and access rule management
    based on information in the manifest of bundles to facilitate the capture
    of  package and class references.  In 3.3. we will expand this to cover
    finer-grained API contracts (e.g., clients should not call foo() or
    extend Bar).  Similarly, developers will be given effective mechanisms
    for discovering and minimizing dependencies and checking and managing
    the evolution of component and package version numbers.

    <strong>Bundle Development Tools</strong>
    In 3.1 and 3.2 PDE made gigantic strides in the area of support for
    traditional OSGi bundle development.  Even still, in 3.3. we will improve
    various workflows and classpath management strategies to promote the
    development of robust and independent right-grained components.  This
    covers everything from increased quick-fix and manifest editing support
    to deeper integration with JDT.  In addition, as JSR 291 evolves and is
    included in Java 6, PDE will be there to provide developer support.  3.3
    will also see the need for tooling around OSGi Declarative Services and
    the new application model.

    <strong>Application Model</strong>
    The OSGi R4 MEG specification includes an application model that significantly
    decouples the application from the rest of the system.  The net result is OSGi
    (and thus Eclipse) as a more flexible application container for example allowing
    multiple applications to run concurrently and improved lifecycle around the
    application.  These characteristics are important both to the manageabilty of
    the system (e.g., simplifying and clarifying the shutdown process0 but also to
    various RCP scenarios such as Kiosk-mode and Application Container models.
    In 3.3. we will implement and adopt the MEG application model.

    <strong>Runtime Refactoring</strong>
    In 3.2. we were able to refactor the runtime to split out the registry,
    jobs, content types, preferences, etc.  Unfortunately we were not able to
    complete the job and the Runtime plugin itself still includes non-trivial
    function around the notion of Eclipse applications and various static
    helpers (e.g., Platform).  This introduces unfortunately broad couplings
    between the former runtime elements and limits the usability of these
    independent pieces in various scenarios.  Once the application model is
    split out and the Platform helper methods are replaced with a simple to
    use component discovery mechanism, the Runtime plugin will be a shell or
    facade needed for legacy support.

    <strong>Component Programming Models</strong>
    Eclipse has successfully put Java components on the map and made them
    useful/relevant to normal programmers.  The decoupling of systems into
    components has raised the need for composition coding patterns.
    Traditional Eclipse uses the extension registry.  Traditional OSGi uses
    the service registry.  Both have their benefits and drawbacks.  On the
    whole, component programmers are not particularly well served.  The OSGi R4
    platform specification introducted the notion of Declarative Services which
    address some of these concerns.  Outside of Eclipse/OSGi, component containers
    such as Spring have attracted significant interest.  To better facilitate
    the creation and composition of components we will investigate programming
    models using declarative services, Spring and other relevant component
    mechanisms with a view to widespread use in Eclipse.

    <strong>OSGi R5 Specification Work</strong>
    Much of the success Eclipse has enjoyed with OSGi comes from the fact that the
    Eclipse community has played a very active role in the evolution of various
    OSGi specifications.  With increased interest in OSGi and Java modularity
    (see JSR277, JSR291 and JSR232) this participation has never been more important.
    In addition to promoting Eclipse usecases and the evolution of these standards
    benefits Eclipse, there are a number of gaps in the OSGi specifications that
    Eclipse is currently filling in specific ways and should be addressed in R5.
    For example the management of API in metadata (x-friends and x-internal),
    integration techniques for third party and legacy code, in-place execution of
    bundles, basic notions of data location, ...  The Equinox team will continue
    their active participation in these specification processes and keep Eclipse
    on the leading edge of Java componentization.

    <strong>Server side</strong>
    First it was tools, then it was applications, now server-side programmers are
    waking up to the power of componentization delivered by Eclipse and OSGi.
    In the 3.2 cycle an Equinox incubator was started to investigate the use of
    Eclipse on the server.  It started as a very modest servlet bridge allowing
    Eclipse to run inside a servlet engine and handle servlet requests and has been
    evolving into a full-blown appreciation of what it means to componentize server
    software.  There are many possible directions here and there is no way the
    Equinox team proper will be able to track, support and participate in all.
    However we will spend time understanding the basic requirements as they apply
    to the base framework and add-on services and look to support the usecases
    presented by various other Eclipse projects that are adopting Eclipse on the
    server (e.g., ECF, ECP, Corona).

    <strong>Security</strong>
    Towards the middle/end of the 3.2 cycle the Equinox Security incubator started
    to produce secured versions of the base RCP plugins.  Various tests and benchmarks
    were run to show the general feasibility of the approaches.  With the proof of
    concept complete, we need to progress to understanding what it means for the
    Eclipse team to write and maintain secure code and then look to secure a relevant
    set of plugins using the tools and techniques developed in the incubator.
    Similarly, various people have been working on login and authentication support.
    In 3.3. we should finalize this work and actually include full support for these
    vital parts of the RCP story.

    <strong>Overrides</strong>
    Component development and use is frought with producer/consumer problems.  Component
    producers implement solutions that address a number of usecases and scenarios but
    inevitably consumers come up with additional, sometimes quite divergent requirements.
    As such, the ability of component consumers to "override" or replace metadata
    specifications in the components they are consuming allows them to better integrate
    these components into their situations.  Further it has the potential to free component
    producers and allow them to define default values or settings where previously such
    settings were clearly a violation of their perspective.  This is done with the
    undersanding that consumers are free to override such decisions.  Usecases range
    from tweaking version ranges when bugs and patches are discovered to overriding
    extension contributions, capability definitions, platform filters, ...
