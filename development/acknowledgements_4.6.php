    <h3>Eclipse Neon Acknowledgements</h3>

    <p>The entire Eclipse and Equinox team would like to thank the Eclipse Foundation staff for their tireless efforts, including: Denis Roy, Matt Ward, and Mikael Barbero for not only keeping all
      that infrastructure going, but also constantly improving it; Janet Campbell and Sharon Corbett for guiding us through the Eclipse legal process; Wayne Beaton for giving us improved tools to
      simplify and manage our development process; Ian Skerrett for his help with marketing the Eclipse release; and Mike Milinkovich for running the whole show. In particular, we appreciate the
      Eclipse Foundation providing resources to allow the building and signing of "Mac Apps" as true applications for MacosX, all propertly signed with the new requirements from Apple.</p>

    <p>
      We would also like to thank the users and adopters who support our efforts, through a range of activities, including early testing, being a <a href="https://eclipse.org/donate/">Friend of
        Eclipse</a>, contracting special work, or outright employment.
    </p>

    <p>A special mention should be made to thank to Luis Bernardo and the Apache Batik team who provided service versions on some very old versions of the 'org.apache.batik.dom' bundle, for the
      Neon release train. This was to fix a security issue discovered late in the cycle, and prevented everyone on the release train being required to move up to the latest version at the last minute.
      One of bundles, the oldest version, was even re-compiled with Java 1.2 libraries, as it was originally, which not only shows the age of the bundle, but shows that team's skill and care at
      release engineering. Overall, an excellent example of cooperation and collaboration with other Open Source projects, even outside of Eclipse.</p>

    <p>The Platform Workspace team would like to thank everyone who has helped by filing bugs, testing and providing patches. Specifically we would like to thank the following people who have
      helped improve the Workspace components by their code contributions to this release: Mat Booth, Steve Francisco, Markus Keller, Alexander Kurtakov, Robin Stocker, Lars Vogel and Paul Webster.</p>

      Jalvingh, Holger Schill and Max L. for bug fixes and Stephan Herrmann for work related to supporting external annotation to a JRE container.</p>

    <p>The Platform Debug team would like to thank everyone who helped improve the debugger framework by filing bugs, testing and providing patches. Specifically we would like to thank Lars and
      Tony McCrary for the new icons, Robert Roth for the "greatfix" contribution, Andrey Loskutov, Anton Leherbauer, Philippe Marschall and Richard Birenheide for bug fixes.</p>

      community was quick to verify our fixes. Special thanks to Lars Vogel who contributed in several areas of PDE, reviewed contributions of others and was voted in as a committer during the
      release. We thank Markus Keller for demonstrating high quality bug reporting and answering our many expert level questions about JDT and Platform. We appreciate all of the value our community
