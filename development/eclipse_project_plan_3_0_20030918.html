<h1>Eclipse Project<br>
DRAFT 3.0 Plan</h1>
<p>Last revised Thursday, September 18, 2003 (<img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12"> 
  marks interesting changes since the <a href="eclipse_project_plan_3_0_20030522.html">previous 
  draft of May 22, 2003</a>)<br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please send comments about this draft plan to the </i><a href="mailto:eclipse-dev@eclipse.org">eclipse-dev@eclipse.org</a>
<i>developer mailing list.</i></p>
<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the next feature release
of Eclipse after 2.1, designated release 3.0 (<a href="why_eclipse_3_0.html">Why
Eclipse &quot;3.0&quot;?</a>).
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Deliverables">Release deliverables</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Milestones">Release milestones</a></li>
  <li><a href="#TargetOperatingEnvironments">Target operating environments</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Compatibility">Compatibility with previous releases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Platform">Eclipse Platform subproject</a></li>
  <li><a href="#JDT">Java development tools (JDT) subproject</a></li>
  <li><a href="#PDE">Plug-in development environment (PDE) subproject</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely static. To
ensure the planning process is transparent and open to the entire Eclipse
community, we (the Eclipse PMC) post plans in an embryonic form and revise them
throughout the release cycle.
<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of release
deliverables, release milestones, target operating environments, and
release-to-release compatibility. These are all things that need to be clear for
any release, even if no features were to change.&nbsp;
<p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the various Eclipse
subprojects. Each plan item covers a feature or API that is to be added to
Eclipse, or some aspect of Eclipse that is to be improved. Each plan item has
its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with a title and a concise
summary (usually a single paragraph) that explains the work item at a suitably
high enough level so that everyone can readily understand what the work item is
without having to understand the nitty-gritty detail.
<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite
large, others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that is localized
to a single Platform component; others may involve coordinated changes to
several components; other may pervade the entire Platform. Although some plan
items are for work that is more pressing that others, the plan items appear in
no particular order.
<p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan for how we
will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs, improving test coverage,
documentation, examples, performance, usability, etc. are considered routine
ongoing maintenance activities and are not included in this plan unless they
would also involve a significant change to the API or feature set, or involve a
significant amount of work. All interesting feature work is accounted for in
this plan.
<p>The current status of each plan item is noted:
<ul>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we have
    decided to address for the release.</li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are
    considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
    investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say
    that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a proposal
    will either be committed, deferred, or rejected.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
    to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note as
    to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed plan
    items at a later point.</li>
  <li><b>Rejected</b> plan item - Plan items that were proposed but judged
    unworkable are marked as rejected plan items, with an accompanying summary
    of why they were dismissed. Keeping track of rejected items avoids repeating
    the discussion.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Deliverables"></a>Release deliverables</h2>
<p>The release deliverables have the same form as previous releases, namely:
<ul>
  <li>Source code release for Eclipse Project, available as versions tagged
    &quot;R3_0&quot; in the Eclipse Project <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/">CVS
    repository</a>.</li>
  <li>Eclipse Project SDK (includes Platform, JDT, and PDE source zips)
    (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse Platform runtime binary distribution (downloadable).</li>
  <li>JDT runtime binary distribution (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse SDK Examples (downloadable).</li>
  <li>SWT distribution (downloadable).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Milestones"></a>Release milestones</h2>
<p>Release milestone occurring at roughly 6 week intervals exist to facilitate
coarse-grained planning and staging. The milestones for 2003 are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Friday June 6, 2003 - Milestone 1 (3.0 M1) - stable build reflecting progress</li>
  <li>Friday July 18, 2003 - Milestone 2 (3.0 M2) - stable build reflecting progress</li>
  <li>Friday August 29, 2003 - Milestone 3 (3.0 M3) - stable build reflecting 
    progress</li>
  <li>Friday October 10, 2003 - Milestone 4 (3.0 M4) - initial API freeze for 
    breaking changes - stable build reflecting progress</li>
  <li>Friday November 21, 2003 - Milestone 5 (3.0 M5) - API freeze for breaking 
    changes - stable build reflecting progress</li>
  <li><img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12"> Friday January 16, 
    2004 - Milestone 6 (3.0 M6) - stable build reflecting progress</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional 2004 milestones will be added later. Our target is to complete 3.0
in 2Q2004. All release deliverables will be available for download as soon as
the release has been tested and validated in the target operating configurations
listed below.</p>
<h2><a name="TargetOperatingEnvironments"></a>Target Operating Environments</h2>
<p>In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably current
versions of the underlying operating environments.</p>
<p>Most of the Eclipse SDK is &quot;pure&quot; Java™ code and has no direct
dependence on the underlying operating system. The chief dependence is therefore
on the Java 2 Platform itself. The 3.0 release of the Eclipse Project is written
and compiled against version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform APIs, and targeted to
run on version 1.4 of the Java 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition.</p>
<p>There are many different implementations of the Java 2 Platform running atop
a variety of operating systems. We focus Eclipse testing on a handful of popular
<span class="header">combinations of operating system and Java 2 Platform; these
are our <em>reference platforms</em>. Eclipse undoubtedly runs fine in many
operating environments beyond the reference platforms we test. However, since we
do not systematically test them we cannot vouch for them. Problems encountered
when running Eclipse on non-reference platform that cannot be recreated on any
reference platform will be given lower priority than problems with running
Eclipse on a reference platform.</span></p>
<p>Eclipse SDK 3.0 is tested and validated on the following reference platforms
(this list is updated over the course of the release cycle):</p>

<h4>Internationalization</h4>
<p>The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis for internationalized products.
The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, including
dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided
as the default resource bundles.</p>
<p>Latin-1 locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on all of the above
operating environments; DBCS locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on the
Windows, GTK, and Motif window systems; BIDI locales are supported by the
Eclipse SDK only on Windows operating environments.
<p>The Eclipse SDK supports GB 18030, the new Chinese code page standard, on
Windows XP and 2000, and Linux.
<p>German and Japanese locales are tested.</p>
<h4>BIDI support</h4>
<p>The Eclipse SDK is a development environment targeted at technical
professionals - not an end user application. However, the Eclipse SDK tools will
permit technical professionals who are working in English to build Hebrew/Arabic
end user Java programs which are themselves not based on the Eclipse SDK. The
BIDI support in the Eclipse SDK allows a Java programmer to work with BIDI
strings, code comments, etc. but the Eclipse SDK itself is not designed to be
localized for BIDI locales and its widget orientation can not be changed.</p>
<p><i>IMPORTANT: The above BIDI support is available only on Windows platforms.</i></p>
<h2><a name="Compatibility"></a>Compatibility with Previous Releases</h2>
<p>(<img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12"> We made several wording 
  changes to this section, to emphasize that Eclipse 3.0 will be largely compatible 
  with 2.1 and 2.0. The previous wording suggested to some that everything about 
  Eclipse 3.0 would be different and incompatible.)</p>
<p>Eclipse 3.0 will be compatible with Eclipse 2.0 and 2.1 to the greatest extent 
  possible.</p>
<h3>Compatibility of Release 3.0 with 2.0 and 2.1</h3>
<p>Eclipse 3.0 will be compatible with Eclipse 2.0 and 2.1 to the greatest extent 
  possible. The nature and scope of some of the key plan items are such that the 
  only feasible solutions would break compatibility. Since breaking changes are 
  a disruption to the Eclipse community, they cannot be taken lightly. We (the 
  Eclipse PMC) will have an open discussion with the community before approving 
  a proposed breaking change for inclusion in 3.0. In other regards, Eclipse 3.0 
  will be compatible with 2.0 and 2.1. We also aim to minimize the effort required 
  to port an existing plug-in to the 3.0 APIs. We will provide a comprehensive 
  <em>Eclipse 3.0 Porting Guide</em> that covers all areas of breaking API changes, 
  and describes how to port existing 2.1 plug-ins to 3.0. Up-to-date drafts of 
  the <em>Eclipse 3.0 Porting Guide</em> will be included with milestone builds 
  so that it's possible to climb aboard the 3.0 release wagon at the early stages, 
  or to estimate the amount of effort that will be involved in eventually porting 
  existing plug-ins to 3.0.</p>
<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.0 will be upwards contract-compatible 
  with Eclipse SDK 2.0 and 2.1 except in those areas noted in the <em>Eclipse 
  3.0 Porting Guide</em>. Programs that use affected APIs and extension points 
  will need to be ported to Eclipse SDK 3.0 APIs. Downward contract compatibility 
  is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with Eclipse SDK 3.0 
  APIs would ensure compliance with Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 APIs. Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving 
  Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain 
  contract compatibility.</p>
<p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.0 will be upwards binary-compatible 
  with Eclipse SDK 2.0 and 2.1 except in those areas noted in the <em>Eclipse 
  3.0 Porting Guide</em>. Plug-ins that use affected APIs and extension points 
  will need to be ported and recompiled for Eclipse SDK 3.0. Downward plug-in 
  compatibility is not supported. Plug-ins for Eclipse SDK 3.0 will not be usable 
  in Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1. Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving 
  Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain 
  binary compatibility.
<p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.0 will be upwards source-compatible 
  with Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 except in the areas noted in the <em>Eclipse 3.0 
  Porting Guide</em>. This means that source files written to use Eclipse SDK 
  2.0 or 2.1 APIs might successfully compile and run against Eclipse SDK 3.0 APIs, 
  although this is not guaranteed. Downward source compatibility is not supported. 
  If source files use new Eclipse SDK APIs, they will not be usable with an earlier 
  version of the Eclipse SDK.
<p><b>Workspace Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.0 will be upwards workspace-compatible 
  with Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 unless noted. This means that workspaces and projects 
  created with Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 can be successfully opened by Eclipse SDK 
  3.0 and upgraded to a 3.0 workspace. This includes both hidden metadata, which 
  is localized to a particular workspace, as well as metadata files found within 
  a workspace project (e.g., the .project file), which may propagate between workspaces 
  via file copying or team repositories. Individual plug-ins developed for Eclipse 
  SDK 3.0 should provide similar upwards compatibility for their hidden and visible 
  workspace metadata created by earlier versions; 3.0 plug-in developers are responsible 
  for ensuring that their plug-ins recognize 3.0, 2.1, and 2.0 metadata and process 
  it appropriately. User interface session state may be discarded when a workspace 
  is upgraded. Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. A workspace 
  created (or opened) by a product based on Eclipse 3.0 will be unusable with 
  a product based an earlier version of Eclipse. Visible metadata files created 
  (or overwritten) by Eclipse 3.0 will generally be unusable with earlier versions 
  of Eclipse.
<p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and certainly 
  everything in a package with &quot;internal&quot; in its name, are considered 
  implementation details which may vary between operating environment and are 
  subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend on anything 
  other than what is specified in the Eclipse SDK API are inherently unsupportable 
  and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single release much less 
  with an earlier releases. Refer to <i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How 
  to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write compliant 
  plug-ins. 
<h2>Eclipse Project Subprojects</h2>
The Eclipse Project consists of 3 subprojects. Each subproject is covered in its
own section:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Platform">Eclipse Platform subproject</a></li>
  <li><a href="#JDT">Java development tools (JDT) subproject</a></li>
  <li><a href="#PDE">Plug-in development environment (PDE) subproject</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For each subproject, the items listed reflect new features of the Eclipse Platform, 
  or areas where existing features will be significantly reworked. Each item indicates 
  the components likely affected by that work item (many items involve coordinated 
  changes to several components). Numbers in parentheses link to bugzilla problem 
  reports for that plan item (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?product=JDT&product=PDE&product=Platform&keywords=plan&target_milestone=3.0&target_milestone=3.0+M1&target_milestone=3.0+M2&target_milestone=3.0+M3&target_milestone=3.0+M4&target_milestone=3.0+M5">query 
  bugzilla for all 3.0 plan items</a>). 
<h2><a name="Platform">Eclipse Platform subproject</a></h2>
<p>The Eclipse Platform provides the most fundamental building blocks. Plan
items reflect new features of the Eclipse Platform, or areas where existing
features will be significantly reworked. Many of the changes under consideration
for the next release of the Eclipse Platform address three major themes. Since
each theme has a number of items, the committed, proposed, and deferred plan
items are grouped in sections by theme:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#ThemeUserExperience">User experience theme</a> - Improving
    Eclipse from the point of view of the end user.</li>
  <li><a href="#ThemeResponsiveUI">Responsive UI theme</a> - Making it easier to
    write Eclipse plug-ins that keep the UI responsive.</li>
  <li><a href="#ThemeRCP">Rich client platform theme</a> - Generalizing Eclipse
    into a platform for building non-IDE applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are important Eclipse Platform improvements that do not
naturally fit into any of the above themes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#OtherPlatform">Other Eclipse Platform items</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="ThemeUserExperience">Theme: User Experience</a></h3>
<p>Improving Eclipse from the point of view of the end user. This includes
improving both the &quot;out of the box&quot; experience so that new users are
productive faster, and finding better ways to scale up to large numbers of
plug-ins without overwhelming the user.</p>
<h4>Committed Items (Eclipse Platform subproject, User Experience theme)</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Improve UI scalability.</b> Despite efforts to ensure UI scalability
  with a large base of available tools, the Eclipse workbench still intimidates
  many users with long menus, wide toolbars, and lengthy flat lists of
  preferences. This problem is acute in large Eclipse-based products. The
  Platform should provide additional ways for controlling workbench clutter,
  such as further menu and toolbar customizability, distinguishing between
  novice and advanced functions, supporting different developer roles, and more
  specific object contributions for particular file types. [Platform UI,
  Platform Debug, JDT UI] [Theme: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37929">37929</a>)</p>
  <p><b>Improve initial user experience.</b> Users who are new to an
  Eclipse-based product can find their first experiences with it overwhelming,
  even daunting. The initial experience would be improved if a product could
  preconfigure the workbench to show only the subset of function that a new user
  really needs; welcome pages could be personalized for particular users roles
  or levels of experience. [Platform UI] [Theme: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37664">37664</a>)</p>
  <p><b>Aid ongoing learning.</b> Users who work with a complex Eclipse-based
  product need not be familiar with all of its function in order to be
  productive. When they do come to use function which they have never used
  before (or not recently enough to be fresh in memory), it is important that
  the product be able to quickly train and guide the user in using that new
  function. The current Eclipse has many elements that aid learning (examples,
  tips and tricks, F1 help, active help links); the work item is to apply them
  effectively in the Eclipse UI and recommend how other plug-ins do similarly.
  [Platform UI, Help] [Theme: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37666">37666</a>)</p>
  <p><b>Improve UI affordances.</b> There are a number of areas of the UI where
  Eclipse is not providing enough cues to the user (e.g., no cue for available
  help, no cue for maximize/restore view, no cue for mandatory/optional fields
  in wizards). Make a systematic pass though the UI to improve its affordances.
  [Platform UI] [Theme: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37667">37667</a>)</p>
  <p><b>Improve file encoding support.</b> Eclipse 2.1 uses a single global file
  encoding setting for reading and writing files in the workspace. This is
  problematic; for example, when Java source files in the workspace use OS
  default file encoding while XML files in the workspace use UTF-8 file
  encoding. The Platform should support non-uniform file encodings. [Platform
  Core, Platform UI, Text, Search, Compare, JDT UI, JDT Core] [Theme: User
  experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37933">37933</a>)</p>
  <p><b>Evolve the Eclipse user experience.</b> Eclipse 3.0 should have a new
  look that makes more effective use of the capabilities of current desktop
  computers. This includes allowing the user to customize the workbench by
  creating floating toolbars and views, and supporting tear-off views and
  dockable toolbars where supported by the underlying window system. [Platform
  UI, JDT UI, SWT] [Theme: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37997">37997</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Improve keyboard bindings. </strong>Several things should be done
  to improve keyboard bindings. First, custom key bindings currently work only
  in the main Eclipse window, and not in secondary windows like dialogs,
  wizards, and floating views (another plan item). For example, custom editor
  key bindings do not work in a text control in a preference dialog. Eclipse
  should support custom key bindings in the places where the user reasonably
  expects. Second, the key customization dialog should be improved. Finally,
  make a systematic pass through the UI to rationalize the initial set of key
  bindings. [Platform UI, SWT] [Theme: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37934">37934</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Improve editor management.</strong> The current mechanism for
  switching between editors using tabs does not scale to having many open
  editors. Eclipse should provide a more scalable and stable, yet efficient, UI
  for switching between editors. [Platform UI] [Theme: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37670">37670</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Improve text editor interaction. </strong>The text editor should
  support folding of text regions, which can be leveraged by the Java editor to
  collapse regions, such as an individual method's body or Javadoc comment, or
  the import declarations of a compilation unit. The text editor should also
  support splitting so that the user can simultaneously view and edit
  discontiguous regions of the same document. [Platform Text, JDT UI] [Theme:
  User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37671">37671</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Improve text editor presentation.</strong> The text editor should
  support an optional marginal change bar that can show how the current document
  differs from another of its states, such as a local history state or a
  repository version. Also, text editors should support for emphasizing a text
  region by changing its background color. [Platform Text, JDT UI] [Theme: User
  Experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37672">37672</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Improve text editor typing.</strong> The set of key actions
  available in the text editor should be enriched with additional common
  operations like insert line, duplicate line, transpose, and convert to
  uppercase. The current JDT editor support for templates with variables should
  be generalized and pushed down so that it is available in all text editors.
  [Platform Text, JDT UI] [Theme: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37674">37674</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Improve global text search/replace.</strong> Global text search should 
    allow regular expressions in search patterns. The replace action should be 
    more visible in the UI, and be easier to use in the case of bulk changes. 
    [Platform Search] [Theme: User Experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37675">37675</a>)</p>
  <p>(<img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12"> recently committed)

<h4>Proposed Items (Eclipse Platform subproject, User Experience theme)</h4>
<p>The following work items are being actively investigated, but we are not yet
able to promise any solution for this release:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Allow editors to open files outside workspace.</b> A common request is
  to be able to use Eclipse to open a file that is not part of the workspace, or
  perhaps even one on a remote system. In addition, applications would like to
  provide file extension associations so that double-clicking on a file in the
  OS desktop would open the associated Eclipse editor. The operations and
  capabilities available on these &quot;outside of the workspace&quot; files
  would need to be defined. [Platform UI] [Themes: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37935">37935</a>)</p>
  <p><b>Display HTML in a widget.</b> In Eclipse 2.0 and 2.1, the only supported
  option for rendering HTML in the workbench is to use OLE to link to IE. This
  support is Windows only; there is no such option in other operating
  environments. Even on Windows, this only works for IE and not other browsers.
  There are already several Eclipse components that could benefit from HTML
  display functionality in a widget: welcome pages; update manager update site
  overview; hovers that show Javadoc. The Platform should provide a portable way
  to display HTML in a widget and support it in all operating environments.
  [Platform UI, SWT] [Themes: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36952">36952</a>)</p>
  <p><b>Improve workspace synchronization with file system.</b> A file resource
  in the workspace gets out of sync when the underlying file in the file system
  is created, deleted, or rewritten outside of Eclipse. File resources usually
  remains out of sync until the user explicitly hits Refresh. The Eclipse
  Platform should provide ways to keep the in-memory representation in sync with
  the file system; for example, by hooking OS file system callbacks where
  available, and by polling for file system changes in a background thread.
  [Platform Core, Platform UI] [Theme: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36962">36962</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Content-type-based editor lookup.</strong> The choice of editor is
  currently based on file name patterns. This is not very flexible, and breaks
  down when fundamentally different types of content are found in files with
  undistinguished file names or internal formats. For example, many different
  models with specialized editors get stored in XML format files named *.xml.
  Eclipse should support a notion of content type for files and resources, and
  use these to drive decisions like which editor to use. This feature would also
  be used by team providers when doing comparisons based on file type. The
  several existing file-type registries in Eclipse should be consolidated.
  [Platform Core, Platform UI] [Theme: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37668">37668</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Improve support for opening workspaces.</strong> Many users use
  multiple workspaces as a way to keep their different projects or work items
  separate. Currently, this requires launching Eclipse multiple times with
  different command line arguments, which is not particularly convenient for
  users. Moreover, when the command line argument is not specified, the
  workspace location defaults to a directory inside where the code for Eclipse
  is installed. Eclipse should improve how workspaces get opened, use a
  user-specific default workspace location more suitable for shared multi-user
  Eclipse installs, and facilitate switching between workspaces. [Platform Core,
  Platform UI] [Themes: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37681">37681</a>)</p>
  <p><b>Provide a general purpose navigator.</b> The Eclipse Navigator&nbsp;view
  presents a view of resources in the workspace. The Eclipse Platform should
  provide a more flexible, general purpose, extensible navigator infrastructure
  that would make it possible to show other objects as well (like an the
  extended physical view provided by Windows Explorer). [Platform UI, JDT UI]

<p>Making it easier to write Eclipse plug-ins that keep the UI responsive. Areas
for improvement run the gamut from the UI becoming sluggish (or temporarily
freezing) when blocking operations are done in the UI thread, to long-running
operations like builds and searches which could be performed in the background
while the user continues to work.</p>
<h4>Committed Items (Eclipse Platform subproject, Responsive UI theme)</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Support concurrent activities.</b> In Eclipse 2.0 and 2.1, certain
  operations like builds and searches always run synchronously and block the
  user at the UI from doing work until the build has completed. The Eclipse
  Platform should support operations running asynchronously in the background,
  so that the user is not forced to be entirely idle while long-running
  operations are in progress. This will likely require an improved concurrency
  architecture with more explicit rules. [Platform UI, Platform Core, Platform

  <p><strong>Establish UI responsiveness targets.</strong> Eclipse should establish 
    quantitative responsiveness targets for key user actions, such as opening 
    an editor, popping up a view context menu, switching perspectives, etc. These

    of the Eclipse UI to be measured and tracked. [Platform, JDT, PDE] [Theme:

  <b>Improve update manager search.</b> Update manager searches for new and updated 
features are done in the Eclipse client. These searches, which can be time-
consuming, are done only on request, and the user cannot do anything in 
Eclipse until the search has completed. There are several ways update manager 
searches could be improved: provide update search APIs; allow searches to run 
asynchronously in the background; allow background searches to be scheduled 
periodically, or on startup; allow searches to be done on the server, thereby 
enabling sites to provide custom search implementations. [Platform Update]

  components of Eclipse are not particularly specific to IDEs and would make
  equal sense in non-IDE applications (e.g., window-based GUI, plug-ins, help

  <p><strong>Remove configuration state from workspace metadata area.</strong>
  Feature and plug-in configuration state is currently stored in the metadata
  subdirectory of each workspace. This has the drawback that product
  configuration actions done in one workspace do not carry over to other
  workspaces. Configuration state should be moved out of the workspace into the
  install directory (single-user installs) or to a dedicated read-write product
  configuration area (shared multi-user installs). This would mean that
  configuration states would be in a known location for external tools to find.
  Different workspaces might still have different configurations, which could be
  achieved by referencing a named configuration state stored centrally.

<h4>Proposed Items (Eclipse Platform subproject, Rich Client Platform theme)</h4>
<p>The following work items are being actively investigated, but we are not yet
able to promise any solution for this release:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Support adding and removing plug-ins dynamically.</strong>
  Installation and configuration of features and plug-ins currently only happens
  during Eclipse Platform startup. The plug-in registry should be made dynamic
  so that features and plug-ins can be added or removed without necessarily
  having to restart Eclipse. This will also entail adding mechanisms for
  handling the arrival and departure of extensions and extension points.
  Additional mechanisms such as services will be added to support the dynamic
  programming model. Alternative runtimes (e.g., OSGi) which offer explicit
  support for dynamic components will also be investigated and used as
  appropriate. Plug-in developers will likely require additional support from
  PDE in writing and debugging well-behaved dynamic plug-ins. [Platform Core,
  PDE] [Theme: Rich client platform] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37687">37687</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Allow plug-in deactivation.</strong> In order to scale to a large
  number of plug-ins, Eclipse does not activate a plug-in until its code is
  actually needed. However, once activated a plug-in remains active for the
  remainder of the session. Unfortunately, this means that an active plug-in
  will occupy memory space for its code and objects even if it is only used
  occasionally. Many users have sessions lasting days or weeks, and this bloat
  taxes processor memory and JVM performance. The analogy is a long play where
  the actors enter the stage on cue, but cannot leave it until the play is over.
  The Eclipse Platform should support plug-ins that can be safely deactivated
  when the user needs to recover valuable memory space. Another alternative is
  to provide a way to quietly shutdown and restart the Platform. [Platform Core,
  Platform UI] [Theme: Rich client platform] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36956">36956</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Add a security model.</strong> Security needs are pervasive. The
  Eclipse Platform should provide the basic framework for a security mechanism
  that can be used by all plug-ins, including a simple credentials store and
  user authentication. Additionally, key parts of the Platform itself should be
  secured, such as the ability to install plug-ins, which might need to be
  restricted in certain products or for certain users. [Platform Core, Platform
  Update] [Theme: Rich client platform] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37692">37692</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Support product branding.</strong> Eclipse-based products need the
  ability to adopt a product-specific look and/or apply corporate branding.
  Eclipse should provide mechanisms to allow such customization. This must be
  done in such a way that plug-ins can be developed independent of any
  particular look, and can be shared across products with different looks.

  <p><strong>Improve SWT accessibility support.</strong> In Eclipse 2.1, SWT
  controls tap in to the MSAA 1.3 accessibility support, allowing accessible UIs
  to be built with SWT on Windows. SWT accessibility support should be extended
  to GTK operating environments, and updated on Windows for MSAA 2.0. [SWT] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37694">37694</a>)</p>
  <p><b>Improve action contributions.</b> The current action contribution story
  is diverse and complex, and the interactions between key bindings and
  retargetable actions, unclear. Eclipse should unify the action contribution
  support, provide simplified support for key bindings, and clarify the
  interactions between key bindings and retargetable actions. Eclipse should
  also support new types of actions contributions, such as combo boxes in
  toolbars, and enable additional UI customization. [Platform UI] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36968">36968</a>)</p>

  <p><strong>Improve UI guidelines.</strong> The current Eclipse UI guidelines
  are somewhat dated and do not cover as much as they need to. Eclipse should
  provide comprehensive UI guidelines so that plug-in developers can create
  plug-ins with UIs that fit well into the overall Eclipse workbench (a subset
  of these guidelines would likely apply to general applications built with
  Eclipse). [Platform UI] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37695">37695</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Remove dependency on Xerces.</strong> The Xerces plug-in currently
  provides XML support for the Eclipse platform. XML support is now incorporated
  into J2SE 1.4, and the presence of the Xerces plug-in can create conflicts.
  Eclipse Platform should consistently use the built-in XML support that ships
  with JDK 1.4, or possibly an alternative XML parser such as <a href="http://www.xmlpull.org/">XMLPull</a>
  which has a much smaller footprint. [Platform Core] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37696">37696</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Improve Ant.</strong> Eclipse should allow the option of running

  <b>Support HTML help pages in archives.</b> A JAR or zip file is a convenient way to

  <b>Improve organizational control over product updates.</b> In organizations where 
there are many users and installs of the same Eclipse product, the local 
administrator should have ways of managing how the product installs gets 
updated. For example, the local administrator should be able to proxy a remote 
update site and serve up supported updates hosted locally within the 
organization, thereby conserving bandwidth, minimizing download failures, and 
keeping things inside the organization's firewall. [Platform Update]

  <p><b>Provide improved table and table tree widgets. </b>Eclipse customers are
  finding that the existing table and table tree custom SWT widgets lacks
  required functionality, exhibit undesirable layout and resizing behavior, and
  are generally ill-suited for presenting large data models. Their largely
  unsuccessful attempts to define their own custom table tree widget have shown

  <p><strong>Improve feature model and build support.</strong> The current
  nested feature structure is static and unconditional. This makes nested
  features hard for developers to manage (version brittleness, platform-specific
  feature ids) and greatly increases the download size of service releases. We
  should allow all included features and a feature's required plug-ins to be
  conditionalized, and improve PDE to build nested features and fill in
  constituent version numbers at build time. [Platform Core, Platform Update,

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Improve team control over resource operations.</strong> Eclipse
  currently provides limited hooks (edit/save, move/delete) so that team
  providers can control or influence operations on resources in the workspace.
  However, there are some aspects and operations over which team providers have
  little or no influence, such as resource creation and copying. Eclipse should
  offer team providers better control over resource operations. [Platform Core,
  Platform Team] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37722">37722</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Support logical resources.</strong> The Eclipse Platform supports a
  strong physical view of projects, files, and folders in the workspace.
  However, there are many situations where a physical view is not the most
  salient or useful for many purposes. In some cases, multiple distinct objects
  happen to be stored in a single file, like an archive. Conversely, in other
  cases, something that is logically a single object is stored across multiple
  files. This discrepancy between logical and physical creates problems for
  common operations such as searching, comparing, and versioning, which need to
  work in the physical realm. Eclipse should support some way of mapping between
  a logical view and the physical organization of files on disk. [Platform Core,
  Platform UI] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37723">37723</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Provide Swing interoperability.</strong> Eclipse plug-in developers
  often have existing Swing-based UIs that they would like to integrate with
  Eclipse. Eclipse should provide a wrapper that allows Swing widgets to be
  embedded within a SWT UI. [SWT] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37724">37724</a>)</p>

<h2><a name="JDT">Java development tools (JDT) subproject</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/index.html">Java development tools</a> (JDT)
implements a Java IDE based on the Eclipse Platform. The following work items
reflect new features of JDT, or areas where existing features will be
significantly reworked. The kinds of changes under consideration for the next
release of JDT address two general themes. The committed, proposed, and deferred
plan items are grouped in sections by theme:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#ThemeJavaFamily">Extended Java family theme</a> - Generalizing
    JDT to handle more than just Java source files.</li>
  <li><a href="#ThemeJDTUserExperience">User experience theme</a> - Improving
    JDT from the point of view of the end user writing Java code.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are important Eclipse Platform improvements that do not
naturally fit into either of the above themes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#OtherJDT">Other JDT items</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="ThemeJavaFamily">Theme: Extended Java Family</a></h3>
<p>Generalize JDT to handle more members of the Java family than just Java
source files. This includes widening to handle Java-like languages (such as JSP
and SQLj), and embracing non-Java files containing references to Java language
elements (such as plug-in manifest files and J2EE deployment descriptors).</p>
<h4>Committed Items (Eclipse JDT subproject, Extended Java Family theme)</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Improve support for Java-like source files.</b> JSP and SQLj are two
  instances of languages that use Java syntax. Eclipse should provide better
  support for Java-like source files. For instance, it should be possible to
  index these files so that Java search can find the Java declarations and
  references within; it should be possible to use Java code assist on the Java
  passages; refactoring should be able to take these files into account; the
  debugger should be able to step through the Java passages (<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=045" target="_blank">JSR-045</a>);
  error highlighting should be supported across sections; etc. [JDT Core, JDT
  UI, JDT Debug] [Theme: Extended Java family] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36939">36939</a>)</p>
  <p><b>Support Java references outside Java code.</b> References to Java
  elements in particular classes can show up in specific kinds of non-Java
  source files, such as plug-in manifest files (plugin.xml), extension point
  schema files, and Java launch configurations in the workspace. These
  references should also participate in Java operations like search, move,
  rename, and other refactoring operations. JDT will surface APIs that enable
  other plug-ins to contribute to and participate in these operations. [JDT
  Core, JDT UI, JDT Debug, PDE] [Theme: Extended Java family] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37937">37937</a>)</p>

<h3><a name="ThemeJDTUserExperience">Theme: User Experience</a></h3>
<p>Improve JDT from the point of view of the end user reading, writing, and
navigating in Java code.</p>
<h4>Committed Items (Eclipse JDT subproject, User Experience theme)</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Present logical view of Java objects in debugger.</b> The current debugger 
    always presents the internal structure of Java objects. For instances of standard 
    data structures like java.util.HashMap, the Java debugger should be able to 
    present a higher level logical view of the object (i.e., to show it as a table 
    of key-to-value mappings). [JDT Debug] [Theme: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36942">36942</a>)</p>
  <p><b>Improve refactoring.</b> JDT should add new refactorings, such as add
  parameter, convert constructor to factory method, and extract superclass. JDT
  should also allow other plug-ins to contribute specialized refactoring
  operations, and provide refactoring APIs and infrastructure to make it
  possible for them to do so. [JDT Core, JDT UI] [Theme: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36943">36943</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Improve code formatter.</strong> JDT should provide a new code
  formatter implementation that is more flexible and supports many more styles.

</blockquote>
<h4>Proposed Items (Eclipse JDT subproject, User Experience theme)</h4>
<p>The following work items are being actively investigated, but we are not yet
able to promise any solution for this release:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Improve editor code navigation.</strong> The Java editor should
  allow the user to navigate in the type hierarchy from a selected element. For
  instance, the editor should show override indicators (currently shown only in
  the outliner view), and allow direct navigation to the declaration of the
  overridden method. The editor should also provide more information about the
  currently selected element such as all referenced types, call sites,
  overriders, implementers, declaration. [JDT UI] [Theme: User experience] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37658">37658</a>)</p>

<h4>Committed Items (Eclipse JDT subproject, no theme)</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Improve shared working copies.</strong> There is mechanism that
  allows working copies of source files to be analyzed in the context of the
  rest of the Java model. Currently, shared working copies are hard to manage.
  Eclipse should simplify the management of working copies so that they can be
  used more transparently. [JDT Core] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37659">37659</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Proposed Items (Eclipse JDT subproject, no theme)</h4>
<p>The following work items are being actively investigated, but we are not yet
able to promise any solution for this release:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Add early support for J2SE 1.5 features.</b> The next feature release of
  J2SE is version 1.5 (&quot;Tiger&quot;), targeted to ship in the first half of
  2004. While the contents of this release are still under discussion (<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=176" target="_blank">JSR-176</a>),
  this release is expected to contain extensions to the Java language, including
  generic types (<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=014" target="_blank">JSR-014</a>),
  enumerations, autoboxing, enhanced for loops, static imports (all <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=201" target="_blank">JSR-201</a>),
  metadata facility (<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=175">JSR-175</a>),
  and compiler APIs (<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=199" target="_blank">JSR-199</a>).
  Supporting these new language and compiler features will require major changes
  to the Eclipse Java compiler, JDT Core APIs, and JDT UI, and may suggest new
  Java 1.5-specific refactorings. Although Eclipse 3.0 might ship before J2SE
  1.5 does, Eclipse should contain early support for J2SE 1.5 features wherever
  possible [JDT Core, JDT UI, JDT Debug] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36938">36938</a>)</p>
  <p><b>Harmonize Java source manipulation.</b> The Java model is currently
  implemented in terms of JDOM, an early precursor of the AST facility added in
  2.0. JDT will move to an AST-based implementation of the Java model, and
  deprecate JDOM. [JDT Core] (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36941">36941</a>)</p>
