Eclipse Project<br>

DRAFT 2.1 Plan</h1>

<p>Last revised Friday, October 11, 2002 (<img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12">
marks interesting changes since the <a href="eclipse_project_plan_2_1_20020910.html">previous draft of
Sept. 10</a>)<br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please send comments about this draft plan to the </i><a href="mailto:eclipse-dev@eclipse.org">eclipse-dev@eclipse.org</a>
<i>developer mailing list.</i> </p>

<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the next feature release 
  of Eclipse, designated release 2.1. 
<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely static. To make 
  the planning process more transparent and open to the Eclipse community, we 
  (the Eclipse PAC) are posting the plan in an embryonic form and are revising 
  it throughout the release cycle.&nbsp;
<p>The first part of the plan
deals with the important matters of release deliverables, release milestones,
target operating environments, and release-to-release compatibility. These are
all things that need to be clear for any release, even if no features were to
change.&nbsp;<p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the various
Eclipse subprojects. Each plan item covers a feature or API that is to be added
to Eclipse, or some aspect of Eclipse that is to be improved. Each plan item has
a title and a concise summary (usually a single paragraph) that explains the
work item at a suitably high enough level so that everyone can readily
understand what the work item is without having to understand the nitty-gritty
details (which can be hashed out elsewhere).&nbsp;
<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite large, 
  others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that is localized to a 
  single Platform component; others may involve coordinated changes to several 
  components; other may pervade the entire Platform.
<p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan for how we 
  will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs, improving test coverage, documentation, 
  examples, etc. are considered routine ongoing maintenance activities and are 
  not included in this plan unless they would also involve a significant change 
  to the API or feature set, or involve a significant amount of work. All interesting 
  feature work is accounted for in this plan.
<p>The current status of each plan item is
noted:
<ul>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposal for an aspect to work on for the
    release. After due consideration, a proposal will either be committed,
    rejected, or deferred.</li>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we have decided 
    to address for the release.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that did not make it in 
    to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note as 
    to why they were deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as proposed plan 
    items at a later point.</li>
  <li><b>Rejected</b> plan item - Plan items that were proposed but judged unworkable 
    are marked as rejected plan items, with an accompanying summary of why they 
    were dismissed. Keeping track of rejected items avoids repeating the discussion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Release deliverables</h2>

<p>The release deliverables have the same form as previous releases, namely:

<ul>

  <li>Source code release for Eclipse Project, available as versions tagged &quot;R2_1&quot; 
    in the Eclipse Project <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/">CVS repository</a>.</li>

  <li>Eclipse Project SDK (includes Platform, JDT, and PDE source zips)

    (downloadable).</li>

  <li>Eclipse Platform runtime binary distribution (downloadable).</li>

  <li>JDT runtime binary distribution (downloadable).</li>

  <li>Eclipse SDK Examples (downloadable).</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="Milestones"></a>Release milestones</h2>

<p>Release milestone occurring at roughly monthly intervals exist to facilitate
coarse-grained planning and staging. The milestones for the remainder of this
year are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>September 20, 2002 - Milestone 1 - (2.1 M1) - stable build reflecting progress</li>
  <li>October 18, 2002 - Milestone 2 - (2.1 M2) - stable build reflecting progress</li>
  <li>November 15, 2002 - Milestone 3 - (2.1 M3) - stable build reflecting
    progress</li>
  <li>December 13,&nbsp; 2002 - Milestone 4 - (2.1 M4) - stable build reflecting
    progress</li>
</ul>

<p> Additional 2003 milestones will be added later. Our target
is to complete 2.1 late in 1Q2003. All release deliverables will be available for download as 
  soon as the release has been tested and validated in the target operating configurations 
  listed below.</p>

<h2>Target Operating Environments</h2>



<p>In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably current
versions of the underlying operating environments.</p>

<p>Most of the Eclipse SDK is &quot;pure&quot; Java™ code and has no direct
dependence on the underlying operating system. The chief dependence is therefore
on the Java 2 Platform itself. The 2.0 release of the Eclipse Project is written
and compiled against version 1.3 of the Java 2 Platform APIs, and targeted to
run on either version 1.3 or 1.4 of the Java 2 Runtime Environment, Standard
Edition.</p>
<p>Eclipse SDK 2.0 has been tested and validated on the following Java 2
Platform implementations:</p>

<h4>Internationalization</h4>
<p>The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis for internationalized products.
The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, including
dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided
as the default resource bundles.</p>
<p>Latin-1 locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on all of the above
operating environments; DBCS locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on
the Windows, GTK, and Motif window systems; BIDI locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK
only on Windows operating environments.
<p>The Eclipse SDK supports GB 18030, the new Chinese code page standard, on
Windows 2000 and XP only. Note that GB 18030 also requires locale and character
encoding support from the Java 2 Runtime Environment; this support is standard
in version 1.4, and also available in some 1.3 JREs.
<p>German and Japanese locales have been tested.
<h4>BIDI support</h4>
<p>The Eclipse SDK is a development environment targeted at technical
professionals - not an end user application. However, the Eclipse SDK tools will
permit technical professionals who are working in English to build Hebrew/Arabic
end user Java programs which are themselves not based on the Eclipse SDK. The
BIDI support in the Eclipse SDK allows a Java programmer to work with BIDI
strings, code comments, etc. but the Eclipse SDK itself is not designed to be
localized for BIDI locales and its widget orientation can not be changed.</p>
<p><i>IMPORTANT: The above BIDI support is available only on Windows platforms.</i></p>

<h2>

Compatibility with Previous Releases</h2>

<p>

It is a given that Eclipse 2.1 will be upwards compatible with Eclipse 2.0. And
incompatible break with the past this early on would be both unwelcome and
unwarranted.</p>

<h3>

Compatibility of Release 2.1 with 2.0</h3>

The Eclipse SDK 2.1 will be upwards compatible with the Eclipse SDK 2.0 to the 
greatest extent possible. We anticipate a small number of areas where slavishly 
maintaining compatibility would not be in the best interests of the Platform or 
its clients. All such exceptions will be noted in the 2.1 release notes so that 
clients can assess the impact of these changes on their plug-ins and products.

<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> The Eclipse SDK 2.1 will be upwards contract-compatible 
  with the Eclipse SDK 2.0 unless noted. This means that programs in full compliance 
  with contracts specified in the Eclipse SDK 2.0 APIs will automatically be in 
  full compliance with the Eclipse SDK 2.1 APIs. (API is construed broadly to 
  include such things as plug-in extension points.) Downward contract compatibility 
  is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with the Eclipse SDK 
  2.1 APIs would ensure compliance with the Eclipse SDK 2.0 APIs. 
<p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> The Eclipse SDK 2.1 will be upwards 
  binary-compatible with the Eclipse SDK 2.0 unless noted. This means that plug-ins 
  built for the Eclipse SDK 2.0 will continue to work correctly in the Eclipse 
  SDK 2.1 without change. Downward plug-in compatibility is not supported. Plug-ins 
  for the Eclipse SDK 2.1 are unlikely to be usable in the Eclipse SDK 2.0. Plug-ins 
  with hard-coded references in their plug-in manifest file to 2.0 versions of 
  prerequisite Eclipse Project plug-ins will work in 2.1 provided the version match
rule is &quot;greaterOrEqual&quot;
or &quot;compatible&quot; (the default); references
using &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;equivalent&quot; match rules will be broken. 
<p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> The Eclipse SDK 2.1 will be upwards source-compatible 
  with the Eclipse SDK 2.0 unless noted. This means that source files written 
  to use the Eclipse SDK 2.0 APIs can be successfully compiled and run against 
  the Eclipse SDK 2.1 APIs. Since source incompatibilities are easy to deal with, 
  maintaining source compatibility is considered much less important than maintaining 
  contract and binary compatibility. Downward source compatibility is not supported. 
  If source files use new Eclipse SDK APIs, they will not be usable with an earlier 
  version of the Eclipse SDK. 
<p><b>Workspace Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 2.1 will be upwards

workspace-compatible with Eclipse SDK 2.0 unless noted. This means that

workspaces and projects created with Eclipse SDK 2.0 can be successfully opened by Eclipse SDK
2.1 and upgraded to a 2.1 workspace.&nbsp; Individual plug-ins developed for

Eclipse SDK 2.0 should provide similar upwards compatibility for their workspace

metadata; plug-in developers are responsible for ensuring that their plug-ins

recognize 2.0 metadata and process it appropriately. User interface session state may be discarded
when a workspace is upgraded.&nbsp; Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. A workspace created

(or opened) by Eclipse SDK 2.1 will be unusable with an earlier version

of Eclipse SDK.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and certainly 
  everything in a package with &quot;internal&quot; in its name, are considered 
  implementation details which may vary between operating environment and are 
  subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend on anything 
  other than what is specified in the Eclipse SDK API are inherently unsupportable 
  and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single release much less 
  with an earlier release. Refer to <i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How 
  to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write compliant 
  plug-ins. 

<h2> Eclipse Project Subprojects</h2>

The Eclipse Project consists of 3 subprojects. Each subproject

is covered in its own section:

<blockquote><a href="#Eclipse Platform subproject">Eclipse Platform</a>

<br><a href="#Java development tooling (JDT) subproject">JDT - Java development tooling</a>

<br><a href="#Plug-in development environment (PDE) subproject">PDE - Plug-in development environment</a></blockquote>

<p>For each subproject, the items listed reflect new features of the Eclipse Platform, 
  or areas where existing features will be significantly reworked. Each item indicates 
  the components affected by that work item (many items involve coordinated changes 
  to several components).

<h3>

<a name="Eclipse Platform subproject">Eclipse Platform subproject</a></h3>

The Eclipse Platform provides the most fundamental building blocks. The following items reflect new features of the Eclipse Platform, or areas

where existing features will be significantly reworked.
<h4>Committed Items (Eclipse Platform subproject)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12"> (recently committed) <b>Improve startup time</b>.&nbsp; Progress was made
at improving startup times in 2.0; however, additional improvements are needed. In addition, we need to investigate deferring (or partially omitting) the
recovery of the UI state. [Platform Core, Platform UI]</p>
<p><img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12"> (recently committed)
<b>Allow user customizable
key bindings.</b>&nbsp; Eclipse 2.0 supports configurable key bindings, but only
for editor key bindings, and only configured by a plug-in. The user should be
able to interactively customize the
key bindings for all workbench actions. There are additional customization possibilities including visible actions and perspective layout.
[Platform UI, SWT, Text, JDT UI]</p>
<p> <img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12">  (revised; recently committed) <b>Improve update
manager.</b> Make continuing improvements to the Eclipse install and update
mechanisms. Improve support for installing and updating large products making
use of nested features. Make remote connections more configurable ( connection using a proxy server
behind firewall and authentication) and more robust (time outs). [Platform Core, Platform Install/Update]</p>
<p> <img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12"> (recently committed) <b>Enable DBCS on Linux.</b>
Support double-byte characters on the GTK and Motif window systems. [SWT]</p>
<p> <img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12">  (revised; recently committed) <b>Add workbench
editor navigation
history.</b> The user should be able to navigate between workbench editors with web style back/forward actions.
(Ref: <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=5700">bug 5700</a>)&nbsp;
[Platform UI]</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Proposed Items (Eclipse Platform subproject)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Improve
serviceability. </b> Progress was made at improving serviceability in 2.0; however, additional improvements are
needed, particularly in dealing with error conditions and reporting them in an
appropriate manner. [Platform Core, SWT, Platform UI]<br>
<br>
<b>Add cheat sheets</b>.&nbsp; A cheat sheet is an instance 
    of a simple kind of workflow support used to help the user carry out a
  sequence of steps. For example, &quot;create and deploy a plug-in" is a multi-step process that could be made easier to follow if there was a guide, similar to a recipe that would track the user's progress and provide both descriptive text that explains the steps involved and integration with Eclipse to automate the process. The Welcome Page editor is a simple 
    example of a cheat sheet. Provide a standard API for creating cheat 
    sheets. [Platform UI]</p>
<p>
 <b>Improve Ant support.</b>
Add support to navigate from Ant error output to the corresponding source.
[Platform UI, Ant Core]</p>
<p><b>Improve file encoding support.</b>
Eclipse 2.0 uses a single global file encoding setting for reading and writing files
in the workspace. This is problematic; for example, when Java source files in
the workspace use OS default file encoding while XML files in the workspace use
UTF-8 file encoding. The Platform should support non-uniform file encodings.
(Ref: <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=5399">bug 5399</a>) [Platform
Core, Platform UI, Text, Search, Compare, JDT UI, JDT Core]</p>
<p> <b>Add </b><b>table of
contents support to </b><b>wi</b><b>zards.</b> Extend the workbench wizard
framework to allow Eclipse wizard developers to provide much more substantial
and significant user feedback. [Platform UI]</p>
<p> <b>Support floating
toolbars and views.</b> Allow the user to customize the workbench by creating floating
toolbars and views. [Platform UI]</p>
<p> <b>Allow editors to
open files outside workspace.</b> A common request is to be able to open a file that is not part of the workspace
using Eclipse. In addition, applications would like to provide file extension associations so
that double-clicking on a file in the OS desktop would open the associated Eclipse editor.
The operations and capabilities available on these "outside of the workspace" files
would need to be defined. [Platform UI]</p>
<p><img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12">  (new) <b>Improve SWT
support for right-to-left languages</b>.&nbsp;Allow the appropriate widget orientation
for right-to-left languages. [SWT]</p>

(PDE) consists of&nbsp;tools for developing plug-ins for the Eclipse Platform.

The following work items reflect new features of PDE, or areas where existing

features will be significantly reworked.

<h4>Proposed Items (Eclipse PDE subproject)</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12">  (new) <b>Improve usability.</b>
  F1 help for all PDE dialogs; improved PDE form editors; improved plug-in
  manifest editor Extensions page; more user-friendly support for building plug-ins and
  features.</p>
  <p><img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12">  (new) <b>Add t</b><b>emplate
  API.</b> API for PDE template wizards will be defined, allowing other plug-ins
  to contribute templates for their extension points.</p>
  <p><img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12">  (new) <b>Improve
  build class path for plug-in projects.</b> Plug-ins that make direct reference
  to JAR libraries of prerequisite plug-ins are vulnerable to version ids in
  plug-in embedded in directory names. The alternative, using binary library
  plug-ins for each prerequisite plug-in, leads to a profusion of projects in
  the workspace. PDE will offer a third alternative based on JDT class path containers
  that avoids these shortcomings and interoperates with existing plug-in
  projects.</p>
  <p><img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12">  (new) <b>Add support
  for u</b><b>pdate sites.</b> Setting up an Eclipse update site and building
  its plug-ins and features is not straightforward. PDE will make it convenient
  to define the layout of an update site and create the update site's contents.</p>
