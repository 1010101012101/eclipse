<h1>Eclipse Platform Project<br>
Plan Summary</h1>
<p>Last revised 11:30 February 14, 2005</p>
<p>The Eclipse Platform top level project is currently working on the 3.1 release. 
  The Eclipse Platform, JDT, and PDE&nbsp; subsystems are now into their 4th major 
  release (1.0 in Nov. 2001; 2.0 in June 2002; 2.1 in March 2003; 3.0 in June 
  2004). In addition to the major JDT upgrade to support J2SE5, the overall thrust 
  of 3.1 is solidification and readying it as a platform that will support and 
  sustain a broad and growing base of products and user communities. 3.1 is planned 
  for late June 2005 (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_1.html">plan</a>).</p>
<p>This overall thrust will continue with the follow-up 3.2 release (<a href="eclipse_project_plan_3_2.html">plan</a>). 
  In particular, we will continue to focus on scalability, to ensure Eclipse also 
  works well for everything from small projects involving a few individuals to 
  large-scale IT projects with huge development organizations. We also want to 
  enhance the Platform's support for integrating a wide range of software development 
  lifecycle tools, such as the ones being developed the <a href="http://eclipse.org/test-and-performance/" target="_top">Eclipse 
  Test and Performance Tools Platform project</a>, as well as for integrating 
  the next tier of tools, like the ones being developed at the <a href="http://eclipse.org/webtools/" target="_top">Eclipse 
  Web Tools Platform</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">CDT</a> projects.</p>
