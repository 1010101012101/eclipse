<p>The Eclipse project (Platform,JDT,PDE,Equinox) development team always receives 
  a tremendous amount of support from the Eclipse community throughout each development

  providing patches always results in a better release. To everyone that helped 
  a big &quot;Thank you!&quot;. In particular, the team would like to express 
  it's appreciation to the following people.</p>
