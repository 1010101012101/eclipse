<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 4.7 and 4.8</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 4.7 and 4.8 in ways that affect 
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide 
  instructions for migrating 4.7 plug-ins to 4.8. Note that you only need to look 
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 4.7 plug-in on 4.8.

<h2>1. <a name="platformSWTWindows">Eclipse Platform SWT Windows DirectoryDialog updated.</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Windows <code>DirectoryDilaog</code> OS version Vista and onwards.
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
Eclipse Platform SWT on Windows Vista and onwards introduces a newer <code>DirectoryDilaog</code> which
has the new look-and-feel and better directory selection mechanism. So, apart from the above improvements,
when comparing with the older <code>DirectoryDilaog</code>, one feature goes missing. We used to have the 
option to set a text message to specify the purpose of the <code>DirectoryDilaog</code> using 
<code>DirectoryDialog#setMessage(String)</code> method in older <code>DirectoryDilaog</code>. 
This functionality is no more possible with the newer <code>DirectoryDilaog</code> on Windows.
</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Revisit the usage of <code>DirectoryDialog.setMessage(String)</code>
in your projects, and if needed elaborate the Title field of <code>DirectoryDilaog</code> using 
<code>DirectoryDialog.setText(String)</code> method. Also note, it's recommend to use a minimal set of words
in the Title field of <code>DirectoryDilaog</code> and avoid making it look clumsy.
