      as a component model, as a rich client platform (<a href="http://eclipse.org/rcp/" target="_top">RCP</a>) 
      and as a comprehensive tool integration platform. These services and frameworks 
      include a standard workbench user interface model and portable native widget 
      toolkit, a project model for managing resources, automatic resource delta 
      management for incremental compilers and builders, language-independent 
      debug infrastructure, and infrastructure for distributed multi-user versioned

      The JDT provides the tool plug-ins for the platform that implement a Java

      including Eclipse plug-ins. The JDT adds the notion of Java projects and 
      a Java perspective to the Eclipse platform, as well as a number of views, 
      editors, wizards, builders, and code merging and refactoring tools. The 
      JDT allows Eclipse to be a development environment for itself. The JDT plug-ins 
      themselves can also be further extended by other tool builders.</td>

      The PDE project provides a number of views and editors that make is easier 
      to build plug-ins for Eclipse. Using the PDE, you can create your plug-in 
      manifest file (plugin.xml), specify your plug-in runtime and other required 
      plug-ins, define extension points, including their specific markup, associate 
      XML Schema files with the extension point markup so extensions can be validated, 
      create extensions on other plug-in extension points, etc. The PDE makes 
      integrating plug-ins easy and fun.<br>

      The Equinox project provides the OSGi framework implementation and component 
      model on which the Eclipse RCP and IDE platforms run. The project seeks 
      to implement the latest OSGi framework specification as well as all optional 
      services contained in the OSGi specification. Equinox team members also 
      participate actively in the OSGi specification process. In addition to the 
      standard services and mechanisms, Equinox includes some basic infrastructure 
      such as the notion of plug-in (aka bundle), the Eclipse bootstrap and launching 
      code and the Eclipse extension registry. The Equinox OSGi implementation 
      is suitable for use in embedded, desktop and server scenarios.<br>
